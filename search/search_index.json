To do this, complete the following steps: Export the collection\u2019s PDF from ArchivesSpace , attach metadata, and convert it to a PDF/A . Name the PDF/A according to the Reuther\u2019s electronic file naming convention . Save the PDF/A to the server: Digital_Hold > Reading_Room > Guides_Processed > PDFAs. The PDF/A version of a finding aid is considered a permanent file (no more edits) and the master file. It is the archival version of the finding aid. Save the inventory Excel file to the server: Digital_Hold > Reading_Room > Guides_Processed > WordFAs. Create an abstract for the finding aid on the Reuther\u2019s website (this can be copied from the resource record\u2019s abstract). Add new terms to the existing taxonomies, if needed, to tag the abstract (these should be the same agents and subjects you used in ArchivesSpace). Attach the PDF/A finding aid to the abstract. Email an electronic copy of the finding aid to the Reference Archivist to be printed, bound, labeled , and placed in the Reading Room.

Creating a Drupal Collection Abstract \u00b6 All collections listed on the Reuther website are done so via a collection abstract. Log in to the Reuther Web site In the left-hand navigation bar, click on Log In . Input your user name and password. Open a blank abstract form In the left-hand navigation bar, click on Create Content . Click on Abstracts A new, blank abstract form is opened. Input relevant data in the fields provided Alphasort : Enter the first six letters in your collection title. If the collection were the records of a union, this would be the union acronym, followed by the first couple letters on the collection name (i.e. department, local, etc.), provided there is room available. Use a space after the acronym (ex. UAW De). Title : Type in the full title of the collection from your finding aid. Reuther Names & Subjects : If you have chosen important names and subjects in your finding aid that are a part of the Reuther taxonomy (i.e. not LoC), enter those here. Choose the terms/names from the drop-down list. To choose more than one term/name, hold down the apple key and then click on the terms/names. If a term/name is not listed, see instructions on how to add terms/names. LoC Subjects : Enter the LoC subject terms you used in the important subjects you identified for your finding aid. Choose the subjects from the drop-down list. To choose more than one subject term, hold down the apple key and then click on the terms. If a term is not listed, see instructions on how to add terms. LoC Names : Enter the LoC names you used in the important names you identified for your finding aid. Choose the names from the drop-down list. To choose more than one name, hold down the apple key and then click on the names. If a name is not listed, see instructions on how to add names. Collection Family : Choose the term that best describes where the collection fits within the Reuther Library\u2019s holdings. It is possible for manuscript papers to have more than one term. If nothing specific fits, choose the generic terms \u2013 labor, urban affairs, or WSU \u2013 if not repeating terms chosen in the taxonomies above. If you feel there should be a specific term added, please see the Technical Services Archivist. Size : Corresponds to the extent element in the EAD tag library Enter the extent from your finding aid, in this format \u2013 ## linear feet (## SB, ## MB, ## OS). Separate each size with a comma within the parentheses. Infrequently collections exist in microform format only, or as both manuscript and microform. Disregard calculating linear feet for collections that are microform only. Instead record the number of reels or microfiche, e.g. 5 reels. When a collection is both, record the manuscript extent first within parentheses, followed by the number of reels outside the parentheses, e.g. (3 SB, 16 MB, 2 OS) 5 reels. Calculate extent thus: 1 SB = 1 linear feet, 2 MB = 1 linear feet, 1 OS = .5 \u2013 2 linear feet, \u00bd MB = .5 linear feet Small processed collections may be described using quantity of folders, e.g. 3 folders. Accession Number : Enter the full alpha-numeric accession number following the numbering convention found in Accession Numbers. Date : Enter the dates from your finding aid, in this format - YYYY-YYYY, bulk YYYY-YYYY. Do not use parentheses around bulk dates. Abstract Body : Provide a narrative, no longer than two paragraphs, derived from the History and Scope and Content of the finding aid. Physloc : Enter the bulk stacks location of the collection. Begin with Part number when applicable in this format: Pt 1: (Abbreviate\u201d Part\u201d with capital \u201cP\u201d small \u201ct\u201d space number colon \u2015 separate parts with semi-colon) Most physical locations are in four main parts Floor followed by building section , e.g. 4W Hyphen followed by stack , e.g. -A Hyphen followed by column , e.g. -6 Open parentheses followed by shelf range and close parentheses, e.g. (10), (3-4) EXAMPLE \u2015 Pt 1: 4W-A-6(3-4); Pt 2: 4W-B-6(10) Other locations include reading room and file cabinets, which utilize a less specific, or more specialized formula. File cabinet EXAMPLE \u2015 Raya Dunayevskaya Papers http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/node/2480 Reading Room EXAMPLE \u2015 Wayne State University Commencement Programs http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/node/7418 Include locations for ALL of the material in a collection, including those items transferred to AV, Library, or the vault. Userestrict : Enter any restrictions on use of the collections beyond those that apply for all collections. In other words, do not include the statements common to all collections in the Use statement on your guide. Attach the finding aid per Placing Finding Aids Online . Publish the abstract to the Web site Click Submit at the page bottom. The public view of the abstract will be presented along with the message, \u201cYour Abstracts has been created,\u201d immediately below the title of your collection. Verify the information you created. If you need to change anything, click on the Edit tab below the collection title. Click Submit after you have made your changes. Note If you do not wish to immediately publish your abstract (e.g., there are unresolved restrictions or the abstract is incomplete & will be finished at a later date) you must deselect the check box next to Published in the Publishing options menu at the bottom of the abstract editing screen before you click on Submit. Adding Terms to the Drupal Taxonomies \u00b6 When describing a collection for maximum accessibility, sometimes it is necessary to use subjects and agents that are not already in the in the Drupal taxonomies. The Reuther Library uses a combination of Library of Congress (LoC) subjects and names and local, Reuther-specific, subjects and names. These terms constitute three taxonomies: LoC Subjects, LoC Names, and Reuther Subjects and Names. To add terms to any taxonomy 1 : Log in to the Web site (Click Log In on the left-hand navigation bar & enter user name & password). Click Administer in the left-hand navigation bar. Click on Categories. Find the name of the taxonomy where you want to add the term. Follow instructions below specific to each taxonomy. To add terms to the Reuther Subjects and Names taxonomy: Click on add terms . Type your term in the Term Name field. Follow LoC style (i.e. capitalize first word only in multiple word term, etc.) Add description in the Description field, if needed, to clarify why you are adding the term. Add terms in the Synonyms field for associated broader or narrower terms or for see and see also terms (i.e. searches on any term listed in the Synonym field will produce results tagged with the term in the Term Name field). Click on Submit. To edit existing terms, click on list terms either from the main categories list, or if you are in the taxonomy already, by clicking the List tab. Click on edit next to the desired term. To add terms to the LoC Subjects or LoC Names taxonomies: Search the Library of Congress Authorities to verify that the term/name is LoC. Type search term in field and select search type (subject or name). Click on the red Authorized, Refs & Notes; Authorized Heading or References button to the left of your term. Find the link that says Authority Record and click on it. Click on the term/name and choose the Labeled Display tab at the top (unless you prefer to read the MARC record). This shows you the proper heading and any used for/see from references as well as other headings to search under. If you have found the term/name that you wish to use, follow the remaining steps. If you have not found the term/name you wish to use, follow the steps above to add it to the Reuther Subjects and Names taxonomy. Sometimes, you may wish to use both the authorized LoC heading, plus add a more natural language heading in the Reuther taxonomy if you feel the user may search under both headings. Click on add terms . Type your term in the Term Name field. Add description in the Description field, if needed, to clarify why you are adding the term. Add terms in the Synonyms field for associated broader or narrower terms or for see and see also terms (i.e. searches on any term listed in the Synonym field will produce results tagged with the term in the Term Name field). Click on Submit. To edit existing terms, click on list terms either from the main categories list, or if you are in the taxonomy already, by clicking the List tab. Click on edit next to the desired term. Placing Finding Aids Online \u00b6 The following instructions explain how to attach a PDF/A to the corresponding abstract on the Reuther Library Web site so it is accessible to users: In the Edit tab of the abstract, click File Attachments . Click the Browse button. In the pop-up window, find your PDF/A file on your desktop and click the Open button. Click the Attach button. Append the file name with \u201c_guide\u201d (e.g. LR000555_guide.pdf). If this is the initial upload of the guide (i.e. it\u2019s brand new), go on to step 9. If you are replacing/updating an existing PDF: Click on Publishing options . Select the check box next to Create new revision . If the new PDF was the result of minor edits, go on to step 9. If, however, there were significant changes to the guide, (e.g. an entire Part II was added): Click on Authoring Information . Delete the text in the Authored on : field so it is blank (system will auto enter today\u2019s date). Click the Submit button. Verify that the PDF/A appears at the bottom of the abstract. Only add terms to a taxonomy if you also added the term in ArchivesSpace as agents (LoC Names or Reuther Names) or subjects (LoC Subjects or Reuther Subjects).. \u21a9","title":"Section 5 - Access"},{"location":"05_access/#access","text":"After a collection has been described, the finding aid needs to be made accessible to users via the Reuther\u2019s website and in the Reading Room.

The Reuther Library uses a combination of Library of Congress (LoC) subjects and names and local, Reuther-specific, subjects and names. These terms constitute three taxonomies: LoC Subjects, LoC Names, and Reuther Subjects and Names. To add terms to any taxonomy 1 : Log in to the Web site (Click Log In on the left-hand navigation bar & enter user name & password). Click Administer in the left-hand navigation bar. Click on Categories. Find the name of the taxonomy where you want to add the term. Follow instructions below specific to each taxonomy. To add terms to the Reuther Subjects and Names taxonomy: Click on add terms . Type your term in the Term Name field. Follow LoC style (i.e. capitalize first word only in multiple word term, etc.) Add description in the Description field, if needed, to clarify why you are adding the term. Add terms in the Synonyms field for associated broader or narrower terms or for see and see also terms (i.e. searches on any term listed in the Synonym field will produce results tagged with the term in the Term Name field). Click on Submit. To edit existing terms, click on list terms either from the main categories list, or if you are in the taxonomy already, by clicking the List tab. Click on edit next to the desired term. To add terms to the LoC Subjects or LoC Names taxonomies: Search the Library of Congress Authorities to verify that the term/name is LoC. Type search term in field and select search type (subject or name). Click on the red Authorized, Refs & Notes; Authorized Heading or References button to the left of your term. Find the link that says Authority Record and click on it. Click on the term/name and choose the Labeled Display tab at the top (unless you prefer to read the MARC record). This shows you the proper heading and any used for/see from references as well as other headings to search under. If you have found the term/name that you wish to use, follow the remaining steps. If you have not found the term/name you wish to use, follow the steps above to add it to the Reuther Subjects and Names taxonomy. Sometimes, you may wish to use both the authorized LoC heading, plus add a more natural language heading in the Reuther taxonomy if you feel the user may search under both headings. Click on add terms . Type your term in the Term Name field. Add description in the Description field, if needed, to clarify why you are adding the term. Add terms in the Synonyms field for associated broader or narrower terms or for see and see also terms (i.e. searches on any term listed in the Synonym field will produce results tagged with the term in the Term Name field).

The only exception is for legacy collections that were previously processed whose material was physically separated. In these cases, when describing the AV, oral history, or library materials, use the same numeric code as the associated manuscript or record collection, but apply the prefix for the material type.

Dates \u00b6 The Reuther uses an ArchivesSpace plugin called timewalk , developed by Alexander Duryee at the New York Public Library, to automatically parse Date Expressions into structured Begin and End dates when an ArchivesSpace component is saved. In order for this to work properly, create one Date subrecord for each distinct individual or range of dates and enter the information in a consistent, standardized way. For example, if an ArchivesSpace component contains materials from August 17, 1945 and 1957-1965, create two separate Date subrecords with the following Expressions: 1945 August 17 : This will be automatically parsed into a Single date with a Begin value of 1945-08-17 1957-1965 : This will be automatically parsed into an Inclusive date with a Begin value of 1957 and an End value of 1965 If exact dates cannot be determined, but approximate dates can be inferred, enter the Date Expression as circa [date] . If no dates can be determined or inferred, enter a Date Expression of undated . Alternatively, for lower-level Archival Objects, do not add any Date subrecords; this will result in ArchivesSpace inheriting down the closest parent record's Date information for display and search in the Public User Interface. For example, an Archival Object with no Date subrecords that is a child of a Sub-Series with a date range of 1950-1970 will have that Date range associated with it.

They are meant to assist collection archivists and technical archivists in various aspects of the workflow, including documenting hand offs between curatorial and functional staff, providing narrative descriptions of the work that will be taken at each step in the process, and ensuring consistency and transparency in our born-digital accessioning operations. Born-Digital Transfer Workflow Diagram \u00b6 Born-Digital Transfer Goals \u00b6 Identify born-digital content that fits within the Reuther\u2019s collecting scope and available resources Transfer born-digital content in a way that ensures its authenticity and integrity Transfer and stabilize born-digital content on removable media upon accession to protect against format degradation/obsolescence and to better inform processing decisions Document accessions of born-digital content in a way that records key details about the nature, scope, and location of materials to facilitate ongoing management and processing Born-Digital Transfer Workflow \u00b6 Field/Collection Archivist identifies and conducts initial appraisal on born-digital materials to be transferred to the Reuther (see Pre-Transfer below for important considerations during this phase) Field/Collection Archivist , on their own or in coordination with Technical Services Archivist or Digital Resources Specialist, oversees the transfer of physical storage media or a network file transfer of born-digital content Contents will be transferred off physical storage media by Technical Services Archivist upon accessioning Content received via network file transfer will be moved to a managed transfer location by Technical Services Archivist Field/Collection Archivist will obtain or create (if necessary) an accession number Transfer/staging/backlog directories will be named in accordance with the accession number. If the accession number is not known at the time of transfer, the transfer directory should be renamed as soon as possible after the number is obtained. Field/Collection Archivist will create an ArchivesSpace accession record, documenting any known content description, appraisal decisions, restrictions, and so on. The accession record will be kept up to date at all times by the Field/Collection Archivist and Technical Services Archivist as the location, known extent/quantity, content description, processing status, and so on of materials as that information changes or as additional information becomes known Technical Services Archivist will transfer content from removable media, if necessary, using the Digital Curation Workstation Technical Services Archivist will generate technical/preservation metadata for all transfers, including: Checksums File format reports PII scans Directory trees/file lists Technical Services Archivist will transfer contents to a secure backlog location for further assessment by Field/Collection Archivist Pre-Transfer \u00b6 Prior to transferring born-digital materials to the Reuther, the Field/Collection Archivist will work with donors to identify which materials should be transferred. This is an opportunity to find out as much as possible about the born-digital content that will be coming into our care. The following questions may help curatorial and technical archivists in transferring, appraising, and processing collections containing born-digital materials: What is the nature and scope of the materials? What is the context of the materials within the collection as a whole? Are the materials organized in any significant way? Are there any known restrictions on access or use? What file formats are present? What operating systems and/or what software was used in the creation of the materials? Transfer Types \u00b6 There are a variety of methods that can be used to facilitate the transfer of born-digital content from the donor to the Reuther. The following broad types, and accompanying examples, are not exhaustive but are instead meant to provide some high-level examples of commonly used transfer methods. Removable Media Transfers \u00b6 Born-digital content transferred to the Reuther on physical removable media will be transferred using the dedicated Digital Curation Workstation. The process used to transfer content will depend on the media type and based on whether the media should be disk imaged or if files should be transferred from the media. Examples include: External hard drives Flash/thumb drives CDs (data or audio) DVDs (data or video) SD cards Floppy disks Network Transfers \u00b6 Network transfers are transfers of born-digital content made to the Reuther via a shared, networked location. Network transfers will follow a similar process as file transfers from removable media. Examples include: Cloud transfers (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) Email transfers Network/FTP transfers (e.g., organizational shared drives) Content management system transfers (e.g., SharePoint) Sent by Donor \u00b6 Born-digital content can be sent to the Reuther directly by a donor by having the donor connect to the Donor_Drop folder on rs6. Donors should be instructed to transfer all the materials in one top-level transfer directory (ideally named after the accession number, if known). If possible, a file list/inventory/manifest should be provided by the donor to ensure that all the materials we were intended to receive have been received. Received by Archivist \u00b6 Born-digital content can be downloaded from the internet, copied from a shared drive/network location, or otherwise received directly by the Field/Collection Archivist. Materials should be saved to the Donor_Transfer directory in HOLD04 in a top-level directory named after the accession number. Transfer Methods \u00b6 The primary methods by which digital content will be transferred off of removable media will be by disk imaging the entire piece of media or transferring files off of the media. The method that will be used for each piece of media will depend on an assessment of the media to determine whether or not a disk image is necessary or appropriate. When to Disk Image \u00b6 Disk imaging creates a bit for bit copy of the data on the removable media, including any deleted, hidden, system, or unallocated files. It essentially creates an exact copy of the media that can be mounted to your computer using various built in and third party tools. Disk imaging should be reserved for media that has a high level of artifactual value, interactive features, or if the file system is inaccessible. If the answer to any of the following questions is yes, the media may be a good candidate for disk imaging. Is the media fragile such that the next transfer of files from it may be the last? Were files saved to the media during their original creation process? Does the media itself have a high level of artifactual value? Are there interactive features or other functionality that require a disk image to function properly, such as DVD menus? Is the filesystem inaccessible by the file navigation tools at our disposal? When not to Disk Image \u00b6 Disk images are not essential for every media transfer. They can often result in keeping files (such as deleted, hidden, system, and unallocated space) that we do not want to keep. This may result in using more storage space than necessary, resulting in long term sustainability concerns. Additionally, many tools that we will use in processing born-digital content, such as file format and PII identification tools, will require \u201ccarving\u201d files from the disk image. Therefore, it is often only necessary and preferrable to make a logical transfer of files from the removable media. If the answer to any of the following questions is yes, the media is likely a good candidate for simply transferring files to the Reuther\u2019s networked storage and would not benefit from being disk imaged. Was the media only used to transfer files to the Reuther (e.g., an external hard drive)? Are we only interested in keeping a portion of the files and not the entire contents of the media? Are the contents of the media only ever likely to be used as files and not in any sort of interactive or emulated environment? Disk Imaging \u00b6 TODO: Information about the process by which different kinds of physical storage media will be disk imaged, including information about FTK imager and other similar tools. File Transfer \u00b6 TODO: Information about the process by which different kinds of physical storage media and network transfers will be copied, including information about tools like TeraCopy, rsync, etc. Media Specific Transfer Guidelines \u00b6 3.5\" Floppy Disks \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about connecting the floppy disk drive and using the write-protect tab Data CDs and DVDs \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about transferring files from data discs Audio CDs \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about transferring audio-formatted CDs using Exact Audio Copy Video DVDs \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about transferring video-formatted DVDs, including creating a disk image and potentially an mp4 USB Drives \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about connecting the Tableau SD Cards \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about connecting the SD card reader Zip Disks \u00b6 TODO: Documentation about connecting the Zip disk drive to the write blocker Post-Transfer \u00b6 Assessment/Appraisal \u00b6 TODO: Some information here about reports and tools that will assist post-transfer assessment/appraisal, including file format reports, Brunnhilde, etc. Storage Location \u00b6 TODO: Some information here about where born-digital accessions will be stored after they have been transferred, stabilized, and assessed. Likely some combination of Archivematica and HOLD04, depending on the nature of the materials, processing timeline, etc. ArchivesSpace Accession Record \u00b6 This section documents fields in the ArchivesSpace accession record that will have specific information related to the contents and status of the born-digital materials. All other required fields as detailed in our accessioning documentation will be present, but will likely not have very different content simply due to the format of the materials. Extent \u00b6 The accession\u2019s Extent subrecord should include the total number and type of physical media (CDs, DVDs, floppies, etc.) and/or the size on disk (in MB, GB, etc.) of the materials. The Extent subrecord\u2019s Container Summary could optionally include the kinds of file formats (PDF, .doc, .mp3, etc.) present and, if known, their quantity. Digital Object Instance \u00b6 A Digital Object instance will be added with the location of the materials, kept up-to-date at all times with the most recent location. For materials on rs6 or HOLD04, this will be a file path. For materials in Archivematica, this could be the transfer UUID.","title":"c.

This involves the following: Collection Archivist opens the collection within 90 days. Create an ArchivesSpace resource record using collection-level description (copy and paste any relevant info from ArchivesSpace accession record ). Note If the collection is an addition , the existing ArchivesSpace resource record will be edited instead, to incorporate the new part. ArchivesSpace will amalgamate a new inventory onto the end of the current inventory list. If the collection is an accrual , only an accrual note (extent, date) should be placed in the existing ArchivesSpace resource record. Restricted accruals may be published at the discretion of the collection archivist. If an inventory exists in electronic format, it can be copied and pasted into the EAD template , imported into ArchivesSpace as a resource record, and merged. If no inventory exists, the archivist determines whether the collection warrants series descriptions and/or box inventory and adds these to the ArchivesSpace resource record. List individual boxes separately. 1 All ArchivesSpace exported PDFs are placed in a folder on server as the master preservation copy. Reuther Coordinator is notified. For analog-only / hybrid collections: Reuther Coordinator assigns stacks location. Collection Archivist prepares box labels and labels boxes. Any material being physically transferred to AV* is designated as such and an AV archivist is notified. Reuther Coordinator moves collection to its permanent location and delivers any material to AV. For digital collections: Stabilization (performed by Field/Collection Archivist during accessioning) and AIP creation are sufficient, there is no need to pair digital objects to the ArchivesSpace resource record inventory (that is full processing- if the collection is fully processed later, the AIP can be reingested of necessary). Collection Archivist makes notes regarding actions (discards, transfers, etc.) in the ArchivesSpace resource record and specifies if the collection (or parts thereof) needs processing, to what level it should be processed, and what priority status should be assigned. Assuming further processing is needed, a Processing Queue event is created to indicate the collection is part of the processing queue rather than fully processed and completed. If no further processing is determined, further action is not required beyond the archivist creating a Processed event. The collection is considered complete until such time as reappraisal is deemed necessary. AV Transfers *AV transfers should adhere to processing procedures (i.e., material too large for stacks shelves and machine-dependent media \u2013 see Audiovisual Formats for specifics). Processing Levels \u00b6 Collections or individual series, are processed according to one of three levels: Level Description Level I folder inventory; full arrangement & description Level II box or folder inventory; series level arrangement & minimal description Level III box or folder inventory; collection level arrangement & minimal description On average, it takes 1-2 hours per box to open a Level II or III collection and 4 hours per box for a Level I collection. Regardless of level, processing should generally follow the steps outlined in the sections below. Preliminaries \u00b6 Consult the Stacks & Case Files located in 3N/3S (if you remove a folder, fill out an OUT card) for provenance and supplementary information about a collection. Check for any donor restrictions on access and/or use of the collection. Check the donor agreement (if one exists) or correspondence to determine how duplicates, non-historical materials, and non-manuscript materials (e.g., AV, library) are to be disposed. Note any existing inventory. Make notes of any pertinent information that can be used in the finding aid (i.e., accession date). Consult ArchivesSpace for additional information (accession record, agent(s), etc.) and updated records: Revise (or create) an ArchivesSpace resource record , and begin recording information in the fields, including the Collection Management subrecord (Processing Priority, Processing Plan, Processor, and Processing hrs/unit Estimate), Note that not all fields can be filled out until processing is completed, and some will change (e.g, dates, extent). Update the associated event(s): From the resource record, select the Related Accession record (if there are multiple Related Accession records, select the first one). In the Related Accession Record, select Events from the side nav. Select Edit in the Processing New event In the Processing New event\u2019s edit screen, change event type to Processing In Progress , and link the related resource record. If there are multiple accessions being processed: Link all of these Related Accessions to this single Processing In Progress event record. Delete the individual Processing New event records linked to each Related Accession. 2 Read pertinent literature for information about the donor, creator or subject of the collection. Keep notes for use in the resource record\u2019s History note. After obtaining location information, pull desired boxes from the stacks area. Enlist a page, if available. Inform the Reuther Coordinator of the number of boxes (and types) you pulled from each shelf locations so the Physical Location spreadsheet can be updated. Review the collection. Examine existing inventories to determine original file order and related files in separate locations. If none exists, you may find conducting a brief (i.e., box level) inventory useful. Examine, briefly, the collection as a whole. Become acquainted with the scope of the collection (completeness), years covered, possible topics, present arrangement, and types and sizes of materials. Determine arrangement plan. Review any previously processed parts, if any, to the collection or similar collections (e.g. other union offices, if processing union records) to assist in determining arrangement. Keep in mind extent, research value and donor relations (e.g., the terms and conditions in the donor agreement), in deciding to what level to process the collection (or part/series within the collection). If there is a previous part with series arrangement, the new part will continue the series numbering where it left off. (Skip this step for Level III processing) . If there is no existing discernable order that can easily be maintained, establish series, if needed, by format, subject matter, creating office, document type, or time period depending on what most logically reflects the history of the creator or most useful to the researcher. (Skip this step for Level III) . If there is no arrangement system, decide what is most logical for the entire collection or series-by-series (e.g. chronological, subject, alphabetical, etc.). (Skip this step for Level II or Level III) . Determine if any materials need to be deaccessioned. (Materials that duplicate holdings, fall outside established collecting scopes, are non-historical, subject to donor agreements and legal restrictions). Follow the prescribed actions set forth in the donor agreement (i.e., set aside to return materials to donor) from the case file. If there is no donor agreement, adhere to deaccessioning section of the Collection Policy 3 . Actions include attempting to contact the donor to ask about returning materials, transferring materials to another repository, and destruction. For non-historical materials that may have monetary value, where you cannot establish contact with the donor, materials may be donated or transferred to another institution. If you are unclear discuss with the director and/or the Collections Team. Materials that pose a potential threat to staff and researchers should be transferred to Wayne State University\u2019s Department of Public Safety or Office of Risk Management. Document the deaccession: Create and link a Deaccession Event to the resource record, explaining how and why the material was deaccessioned. If returning materials to the donor, include Certificate of Records Return to Donor , which documents the material being returned (i.e., type of material and amount), and have both the donor and Reuther Library representative sign. Retain a signed copy in the case file. Remove the box(es) from your processing area. Contact the Reuther Coordinator to take the boxes to receiving. If materials will be returned to the donor, or sent to Public Safety/Office of Risk Management contact the appropriate individual(s), and ensure materials arrive safely. Processing \u00b6 The following guidelines give a comprehensive approach. Depending to what level a collection is being processed, not all of the recommendations are applicable. For Level II & III processing, item level investigation is discouraged and thus many of these steps are unnecessary. General Rules \u00b6 Do not arrange material within the folders. Work in storage boxes until final refoldering. For the most part, try to avoid reading through the collection more than one time. If a document requires identification with notations regarding date, place, or author, those notations should be penciled in lightly in the upper right hand corner in brackets to indicate that the archivist made the notation. Arrange the Collections \u00b6 Determine the processing level: For Level III: simply leave the collection as it stands, physically arranging only to consolidate folders within a single box. For Level I or II: Separate the collection into series, if not already determined by creator, separate the collection into 2 or more series. Do not create a collection with only 1 series. Don\u2019t try to work with the entire collection at once. For Level II, leave each series as it stands, physically arranging only to consolidate folders within a single box. For level I, impose (or leave existing) system of arrangement. Discards \u00b6 The following items should be removed from the collection: Blank paper Duplicate copies: retain originals and any duplicates with handwritten notes or different formats. Unimportant items such as grocery lists, minor receipts, etc. Housekeeping items such as bills and cancelled checks Travel, equipment, etc., brochures Routine forms, such as those for travel expenses Papers with only doodles, phone numbers with no names, etc. Empty folders \u2013 set aside those suitable for reuse. Envelopes, unless they contain important information Magazines unrelated to the subject content of the collection (but tear out any relevant article and retain) Government documents, unless removing them would destroy the integrity of the file/collection Illegible materials Summarize discards in the resource record's Collection Management > Processing Plan > Discard section. Preservation \u00b6 Remove rusted metal fasteners and replace with vinyl paper clips, if necessary to preserve the integrity of the document. Discard rubber bands. Place acid-free (bond) paper between deteriorating items. Note the box location and type of low-grade paper (e.g., newsprint, telegrams, carbon paper, Thermofax) in the resource record\u2019s Collection Management > Processing Plan > Conservation Description/Location section for future action. Remove binders and report covers. If necessary, remove all old envelopes and all other unnecessary items. If they contain titles or information not included in the letter or report, trim and retain that portion. For items with water and/or mold damage 4 , do the following: Air-dry small amounts of wet materials. For extensive amounts of wet materials, contact an environmental company to come in and freeze the material to prevent mold growth. Documents bound together via water damage, should not be physically separated. If separating is deemed necessary given the material\u2019s historical value, find a conservator to do so. Material with mold: When dealing with mold, wear protective clothing (gloves, respirators/masks, goggles, disposable aprons or smocks, etc.) Isolate the moldy material from the rest of the collection. Determine if the mold is active. If so, the physical environment where the material was stored must be evaluated . Dispose of the material and record in the Resource record, or if the material is of substantial historical value, place the material in a secure, and dry environment to stop mold growth until mold is inactive. For material with inactive mold, do one of the following: If the material is not of substantial historical value, dispose of the material and record in the resource record. If the material is important enough to remain in the collection, clean. Flag or list items that are torn, soiled, or need flattening. Follow appropriate preservation measures. Physical Foldering \u00b6 Do not arrange material within the folders. Divide the contents of folders thicker than one inch. Try to make logical divisions, e.g. dividing by months or years or by chapters. Where more than one folder has the same heading, indicate multiple folders of the same material. Replace folders that are in poor condition with new or good-quality used ones of a size appropriate for the collection (i.e., letter or legal size). Turn used folders inside out and write on the blank side of the tab. Organize and folder loose material by subject, format, correspondent, or some other logical grouping. Remove hanging folders (Pendaflex) and if necessary, folder their contents. If the Pendaflex tab insert accurately describes the material, use it as the folder heading. Remove and folder material from 3-ring binders, report covers, and envelopes. Use existing headings if they accurately describe the folder contents. These may be taken directly from any existing inventory listing (may or may not include dates \u2013 usually not necessary for Level II or III). Compose appropriate folder headings, where needed, including dates. Be consistent, specific and concise. Print legibly in pencil. When processing is complete and inventory is being created, list box number and then folder number on the upper left corner of the folder tab. Number folders consecutively within each box: Box 1 might contain folders 1-1 through 1-28; Box 5 might contain folders 5-1 through 5-8. If you have unfoldered, bound items, assign them numbers just as you would folders. If possible, lightly pencil the number on the front, or inside cover of the item. Folder Headings \u00b6 As the description of the materials in each folder of the collection is the key to that collection for the researcher, it is important that the folder headings be as accurate, consistent, complete and concise as possible. DACS standards applied in the creation of collection-level description also apply to folder headings, when devised by the archivist. Note that it is acceptable to use fuller description in the ArchivesSpace inventory, and abbreviate on the physical folders. These headings should be written legibly in pencil on the folder tabs. Terminology and Abbreviations \u00b6 Care should be used in selecting words that describe exactly what is in each folder. Library of Congress Subject Headings should be used wherever possible. Try to avoid the use of \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d and \u201cetc.\u201d In general, in the case of names of organizations which are usually abbreviated, such as the UAW, AFL-CIO, etc., it is not necessary to write the name in full, if it is preceded in the guide front matter or a previous folder heading by the name written out in full. In collections with an unusually large number of abbreviations and acronyms a glossary can be provided at the end of the scope & content (or abstract). Do not abbreviate the names of people. An exception can be made in the case of the creator of the papers for specific references in folder headings such as: \u201cWPR Notes\u201d to indicate the notes made by Walter P. Reuther. For states use Post Office codes, such as MI. Dates \u00b6 Each folder heading should indicate the dates of materials in the folder if possible (Level II & III collections may be the exceptions). Write single dates as follows without punctuation: 1945 April 25. Expression of dates should not be given in all numerals. Standard abbreviation can be used for months, but it is recommended that they be spelled out in their entirety on the guide. Indicate inclusive dates as follows: 1935-1939 If there is a significant gap in chronological sequence of the documents in a folder, use commas to separate the dates or date ranges: 1999, 2005-2010 If bulk dates are needed to clarify folder contents use \u201c, bulk YYYY-YYYY\u201d after the inclusive dates. Do not use parentheses. If the document is not dated, but you have been able to determine its age, use one of the following statements preceding the estimated date: approximately circa after before If no date can be determined, write \u201cundated.\u201d Punctuation and Format \u00b6 Do not subdivide a folder heading with a semi-colon unless the secondary information provides added insight into the folder contents. For example, use semicolons to separate the main heading from the subheading, such as: \u201cRegion 3; Correspondence\u201d Use commas before the date or when appropriate to separate words, for example: \u201cCarey, James, Secretary-Treasurer, 1955-1968\u201d Do not use a period at the end of folder headings. Folder headings may be composed using any existing inventory, provided the heading accurately reflects the folder contents. In Level II or III processing this may or may not include dates. When composing entirely new headings, include as much information as possible in the space available. The type of material (correspondence, minutes, etc.) and dates should be indicated where appropriate. Where more than one folder has the same heading, indicate multiple folders as such: (1 of 2), (2 of 2), etc. Box and folder numbers are written on the upper left corner of the tab (or alternatively, the upper extreme right corner of full tab folders). If using an existing heading and there is no room on the tab, write the numbers just below the tab.

The standard is a Paige box. Collections deemed significant in some way may be boxed in Hollinger manuscript boxes. If reboxing with used boxes, make sure one box end is free of old labels and writing, that the information on all old labels has been crossed out, and that the folders are facing the new front end of the box. Put a sufficient number of folders in a manuscript box so that they fit snugly enough to support each other but can still be removed with ease. Place folders in boxes according to the arrangement scheme. Do not leave room in a box because it is the end of a series. Begin the next series in the same box. Use blue \u201ce-flute\u201d spacers to fill any extra space in your last box. Contact the Reuther Coordinator to ask for a physical location for the collection. Provide the number and type of boxes. As the last step in processing, label the front end of each box using the appropriate label template ( ALUA or WSU ). Labels should include accession number, box number (optional: append \u201cof [total box#]\u201d if collection is unlikely to have accrual or addition), collection title (including part #, if applicable), and location. If you are processing an addition or part to an existing collection, your numbering will begin not with Box 1, but where the original collection left off. Do not reformat the labels (unless you need to adjust font size in the title only) or add any other information. If you are labeling a box containing AV , fragile, closed , and/or restricted materials (restrictions are: box must remain at reference desk and/or box must be used at table directly in front of reference desk ), or materials that should not be duplicated , the corresponding color coded label(s) should also be included (contact AV department for fragile labels). Affix labels to boxes using pH neutral adhesive to prevent the labels from falling off over time. When all folders have been arranged and titled, write a draft of the series descriptions in the ArchivesSpace Resource Record > Notes > Scope and Content (Skip this step for Level II & III.) while all the information is still fresh in your mind. Make note of important subjects or names and biographical or historical information about the creator, as you go through the collection, to be used in the finding aid. Description Workflow \u00b6 When a collection has been processed (i.e. arranged), the next step is to create a finding aid (i.e., description) so it can be made accessible. To do this, complete the following steps: Create a DACS compliant description and enter into the collection\u2019s ArchivesSpace resource record , using the appropriate template text based on the processing level (1, 2, or 3). Create an inventory (box/folder list) using one of the detailed methods Update the Processing in Progress event to Processed . If the collection has any restrictions that requires all or a portion of it be closed, add a Temporarily Closed event. If the collection was only partially processed, add a Processing Partial event. Complete the Collection Checklist , and place it in the digital case file (Digital_Hold > Central > Collection_Management_Tools > Accessions > CaseFiles), and hard copy case file, if applicable. Finding Aid \u00b6 Complete collection description based on the Level I, Level II or Level III procedures and template text provided in the ArchivesSpace: Resource Record. Describe your arrangement scheme and create the inventory . Number folders and boxes as you go. Consult the reference file you\u2019ve created from notes taken during the preliminaries and processing, as well as your inventory, to complete the front matter of the finding aid (e.g. title through scope & content). For Level I, complete a full History and Scope & Content note. For Levels II & III, these notes may be shortened or summarized in an abstract only. Edit and revise the drafts of your series descriptions written up while processing (Skip this step for Level II & III) within the Resource Record > Notes > Scope and Content. Completion \u00b6 Complete the ArchivesSpace Resource Record Collection Management Subrecord (Processing Total Extent, Extent Type, Total Processing Hours, Funding Source). Discarding Sensitive Materials and Materials to remove from collection (duplicates, blank pieces of paper, irrelevant materials, etc.): Shred Sensitive materials: Write \u201cSHRED,\u201d the date, and your initials on the box(es) containing material needing to be shredded. Tape box lids shut. Add the boxes to the Room 19 Shred List. Contact Reuther Coordinator to remove the boxes from your area. Shred boxes go to room 19. Discard boxes go to Receiving. Document the discards/shredded materials: Fill out the Resource Record > Collection Management > Processing Plan field > Discard section and indicate the type and amount of material discarded/shredded. Arrange for transfer of any AV or vault materials. Record locations of all material (regardless of physical location in separate departments, e.g., AV and digital materials) in the ArchivesSpace resource record. This is necessary for forthcoming ArchivesSpace physical space management. \u21a9 Processing New events indicate that accessions are not processed and part of the backlog. Therefore, to maintain an accurate backlog and processing statistics, these events must be deleted. \u21a9 SharePoint: Reuther Library > Active Records > Collections > Acquisitions_Accessions > 2018 Final > CollectionPolicy_2019Review.pdf \u21a9 This information came from Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler, Preserving Archives & Manuscripts second edition Chicago.2010: 254-256. \u21a9","title":"a.

Check for any donor restrictions on access and/or use of the collection. Check the donor agreement (if one exists) or correspondence to determine how duplicates, non-historical materials, and non-manuscript materials (e.g., AV, library) are to be disposed. Note any existing inventory. Make notes of any pertinent information that can be used in the finding aid (i.e., accession date). Consult ArchivesSpace for additional information (accession record, agent(s), etc.) and updated records: Revise (or create) an ArchivesSpace resource record , and begin recording information in the fields, including the Collection Management subrecord (Processing Priority, Processing Plan, Processor, and Processing hrs/unit Estimate), Note that not all fields can be filled out until processing is completed, and some will change (e.g, dates, extent). Update the associated event(s): From the resource record, select the Related Accession record (if there are multiple Related Accession records, select the first one). In the Related Accession Record, select Events from the side nav. Select Edit in the Processing New event In the Processing New event\u2019s edit screen, change event type to Processing In Progress , and link the related resource record. If there are multiple accessions being processed: Link all of these Related Accessions to this single Processing In Progress event record. Delete the individual Processing New event records linked to each Related Accession. 2 Read pertinent literature for information about the donor, creator or subject of the collection. Keep notes for use in the resource record\u2019s History note. After obtaining location information, pull desired boxes from the stacks area. Enlist a page, if available. Inform the Reuther Coordinator of the number of boxes (and types) you pulled from each shelf locations so the Physical Location spreadsheet can be updated. Review the collection. Examine existing inventories to determine original file order and related files in separate locations. If none exists, you may find conducting a brief (i.e., box level) inventory useful. Examine, briefly, the collection as a whole. Become acquainted with the scope of the collection (completeness), years covered, possible topics, present arrangement, and types and sizes of materials. Determine arrangement plan. Review any previously processed parts, if any, to the collection or similar collections (e.g. other union offices, if processing union records) to assist in determining arrangement. Keep in mind extent, research value and donor relations (e.g., the terms and conditions in the donor agreement), in deciding to what level to process the collection (or part/series within the collection). If there is a previous part with series arrangement, the new part will continue the series numbering where it left off. (Skip this step for Level III processing) . If there is no existing discernable order that can easily be maintained, establish series, if needed, by format, subject matter, creating office, document type, or time period depending on what most logically reflects the history of the creator or most useful to the researcher. (Skip this step for Level III) . If there is no arrangement system, decide what is most logical for the entire collection or series-by-series (e.g. chronological, subject, alphabetical, etc.). (Skip this step for Level II or Level III) . Determine if any materials need to be deaccessioned. (Materials that duplicate holdings, fall outside established collecting scopes, are non-historical, subject to donor agreements and legal restrictions). Follow the prescribed actions set forth in the donor agreement (i.e., set aside to return materials to donor) from the case file. If there is no donor agreement, adhere to deaccessioning section of the Collection Policy 3 . Actions include attempting to contact the donor to ask about returning materials, transferring materials to another repository, and destruction. For non-historical materials that may have monetary value, where you cannot establish contact with the donor, materials may be donated or transferred to another institution. If you are unclear discuss with the director and/or the Collections Team. Materials that pose a potential threat to staff and researchers should be transferred to Wayne State University\u2019s Department of Public Safety or Office of Risk Management. Document the deaccession: Create and link a Deaccession Event to the resource record, explaining how and why the material was deaccessioned. If returning materials to the donor, include Certificate of Records Return to Donor , which documents the material being returned (i.e., type of material and amount), and have both the donor and Reuther Library representative sign. Retain a signed copy in the case file. Remove the box(es) from your processing area. Contact the Reuther Coordinator to take the boxes to receiving. If materials will be returned to the donor, or sent to Public Safety/Office of Risk Management contact the appropriate individual(s), and ensure materials arrive safely.","title":"Preliminaries"},{"location":"02_arrangement/02_01_general/#processing","text":"The following guidelines give a comprehensive approach.

Note Collections predominantly containing AV materials are processed in the AV department according to separate guidelines. AV material is defined as the following: Photographic prints, negatives, and slides Audio recordings (phonographic records, magnetic tape, digital tape) Motion picture film Video recordings (magnetic tape, digital tape) Graphic art (posters, drawings, prints, architectural plans, signs, banners, textiles) Fine art (paintings, sculpture) Arrangement \u00b6 Regardless of the processing level, AV material is not kept in the same folders or boxes as documents. In cases where an AV item is significantly tied to surrounding documents, a photocopy can be left in the folder it was originally found. If existing folder headings or informative textual material filed with the AV item is the only identification of that item, photocopy accompanying documents or otherwise make a notation to accompany the AV item. Determination must be made upon separation, whether to shelve AV material boxes alongside the manuscript or records boxes or transfer them to the AV Department for storage and access. Use the following format-specific guidelines to make your determination : Photographic prints or any other positive image paper-based materials (i.e., graphic art) are shelved alongside the rest of the collection. Exceptions are: Legal-size (or smaller) items that constitute less than a \u00bd manuscript box. These are given to the AV Dept. to be placed in the small collections hanging files. Oversize items that will not adequately fit in the largest available flat box (approx. 30\" x 40\"). Contact the AV Dept. for storage options. Note For additions to collections, check with the AV Dept. before foldering or boxing to see whether legacy material is already being housed separately. Photographic negatives or slides are transferred to the AV Dept. Audio, film, or video recordings are transferred to the AV Dept. Fine art or sculpture are transferred to the AV Dept. Mechanics Regardless of final stacks destination, house the material according to format. If transferring boxes to the AV Dept., label the boxes (leave AV location blank*). If transferring folders or single items (including oversize) to the AV Dept., either label (if applicable) or write the collection title, accession #, and item # on the folder tab, lightly penciled on the back of the item(s), or written on a separate sheet of paper and attached to the item(s) with a paperclip.* If material is to be shelved alongside the collection, place legal-size (or smaller) items upright in manuscript boxes; oversized materials in flat boxes. Do not place AV items in the same box as documents \u2013 start a new box and use spacers if needed. In addition to the collection label, boxes need a blue \u201cAV Material\u201d label . * Once the collection is processed and transferred items have been delivered to and stored by the AV department, location(s) will be added to the abstract node and/or the ASpace Resource Record by an AV Archivist. Description \u00b6 AV material is described according to level of processing. Regardless of final stacks location, AV material are added to the collection inventory either as the last series (level I & II only) or the last items listed (level III). If single folders (unboxed) are being transferred to the AV Dept., use \u201cAV\u201d in lieu of box number in the <container> tag for boxes. If single items (unboxed) are being transferred to the AV Dept. use \u201cAV\u201d in lieu of box number in the <container> tag for boxes and change \u201cFolder\u201d to \u201cItem\u201d in the <container> tag for folders. If boxes are being transferred to the AV Dept., continue sequential numbering (i.e., do not start over with Box 1). Do not inventory at the item level (unless you only have a couple of items), but instead provide a general statement. Information (gleaned from related documents or notations on the items themselves) such as dates, formats, subjects, events, amounts, sizes, etc. can be used. For example: 10 oversize posters and awards, undated Photographs; Detroit Protests, 1967 8 color slides, 1979 Negatives; Family portraits, 1930-1989 Audiocassette tapes; Conferences, 1960-1969 Important information about any AV material, such as their original location, is included in the collection or series scope and content note. If material is transferred to the AV Dept. describe the material transferred (complete with box numbers) in the Resource Record in Notes > Separated Material. For example: Slides and photographic negatives (Box 10) have been transferred to the AV Dept. 1 film (Box AV) has been transferred to the AV Dept. Oral Histories \u00b6 Oral history materials at the Reuther can be part of papers or records collections, duplicates of material at another archives used for reference purposes, or discrete projects conducted by Reuther staff, donors, or other related parties in accordance with the library\u2019s mission. The following guidelines address all oral history materials from accessioning to access. Oral History (OH) material is defined as any combination of the following: Analog audio and video recordings (film, magnetic, or optical) Digital audio and video files (mp3, mp4, wav, etc.) Transcripts (paper copies and/or electronic files) Arrangement \u00b6 Regardless of how an OH is acquired, if it entails any type of recording, in addition to transcripts, there could be a physical separation of materials due to preservation concerns and access. Use the following guidelines to determine where to store materials: Hard copy, machine-dependent media such as reel-to-reel, film, cassette, VHS tapes, Hi-8 tapes, digital Hi-8 tapes, CDs and DVDs are to be transferred to the AV Dept. Born digital recordings are to be uploaded to the server and backed up on shared hard drives. If a transcript(s) is part of a unique accession or accrual to a unique accession (this includes discrete projects and duplicates): Hard-copy(s) are to be boxed and shelved at 3N-F-1. Single transcripts are to be placed in the last available individual oral histories box and specific arrangement statement added to the resource record. Digital-copy(s) are to be uploaded to the server. If the transcript(s) is part of a papers or records collection: They stay with the collection regardless of format. If digital (e.g., stored on CDs) within an analog collection, then duplicates should be made for the sake of preservation, and uploaded to the server; original media can then be disposed If digital within an entirely digital collection, they will be stored with the rest of the digital content. If the transcripts and/or recordings are digital: First name the materials using the following conventions that apply to both born-digital and digitized oral history recordings and transcripts. For consistency, \"OH\" is added to the file name, immediately following the accession number, regardless of whether or not OH is already part of the accession number prefix. Three digit counter numbers are then added, beginning with 001 and increasing up to 999 (if needed). Counter numbers represent individual recordings and transcripts, disambiguating items in larger oral history collections and providing machine readability. Recording and transcript numbers are automatically differentiated by file name extension (e.g. recordings may end in mp3, mp4, wav, etc., and transcripts will end in .pdf). Continue to use established numbering conventions for corresponding physical materials. These numbers may parallel the numbering for digital materials, but will not be identical to it (e.g., LOH002210.1 for physical recordings and physical transcripts). Recordings \u00b6 File Name: AccessionNumber_OH_Counter#_TapeSide (if applicable) For recordings on tape, always use \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d to denote TapeSide. If there is a recording only on one side of the tape, always use \u201cA\u201d to denote TapeSide, even if the recording was started on side B. Examples: File Name Description LOH002210_OH_001_A.wav an oral history recording on side A of a tape, or an oral history recording from a tape only recorded on a single side UR000501_OH_024_B.mp3 an oral history recording on side B of a tape from a records collection UOH000037_OH_007.wav an oral history recording from a CD or born digital Transcripts \u00b6 File Name: AccessionNumber_OH_Counter# Examples: File Name Description LOH002210_OH_001.pdf an oral history transcript UR000501_OH_024.pdf an oral history transcript from a records collection Additional Project Materials \u00b6 Use the following convention for additional project materials such as project documentation, draft transcripts, biographical sketches, resumes, etc. File Name: AccessionNumber_OH_Counter#_Counter# Examples: File Name Description LOH001952_OH_000_001.doc a project-level file #1, e.g. project proposal LOH001952_OH_000_002.doc a project-level file #2, e.g. final budget LOH001952_OH_001_001.doc interview #1 draft transcript LOH001952_OH_001_002.doc interview #1 additional case file materials, interviewee resume, etc. Much of the above materials will go in the case file, but some project-level and/or related files may be placed in Access and Preservation folders in the Digital Hold, such as introductory essays, interviewee biographies, and the like. Next, arrange the materials using the following guidelines for arranging born digital/digitized oral history transcripts and recordings. Project Materials \u00b6 Ensure all files follow oral history naming conventions ( recordings , transcripts , project materials ). First determine if the file is access or preservation: Access: PDF, MP3, JPEG, MP4 Preservation: PDF/A, WAV, TIFF (If the material does not exist in a preservation format, put the original file in the preservation folder, e.g., JPEG.) Next, determine if the oral history is from a donor organization, or an individual project. Based on this information, the file is arranged as follows: Access file, OH is part of an organization: Digital Hold > OH > Access > [organization] > [accession #] Access file, OH is not part of an organization: Digital Hold > OH > Access > Projects > [accession #] OR Digital Hold > OH > Access > Individual > [accession #] Preservation file, OH is part of an organization: Digital Hold > OH > Preservation > [organization] > [accession #] Preservation file, OH is NOT part of an organization: Digital Hold > OH > Preservation > Projects > [accession #] OR Digital Hold > OH > Preservation > Individual > [accession #] Case File Materials \u00b6 Create a case file for the oral history if one does not already exist: Digital Hold > Central > Collections > Collection_Management_Tools > Accessions > Casefiles > Oral Histories > [Accession #]: Add the following materials to the oral history\u2019s digital case file. Ensure all files follow oral history naming conventions. Original unedited/non-finalized transcripts (MS Word or PDF) Closed audio or video records Example Donor organization level folder: SWE Project/Collection Level Folder: LOH002110 File Name for an oral history transcript: LOH002110_OH_001.pdf File name for an oral history recording from a CD: LOH002110_OH_008.wav Therefore, file locations are: Digital Hold > OH > Access > SWE > LOH002110 > LOH002110_OH_001.pdf Digital Hold > OH > Preservation > SWE > LOH002110 > LOH002110_OH_008.wav Mechanics \u00b6 Media transferred to the AV Dept. should be labeled with the full accession number (including the unique identifier for multiple interview projects). Digital files of any format (audio, video, transcripts) should be named following the file naming convention (see Section VI below). Hard-copy transcripts should be foldered by interview. Folder should be labeled with box:folder number, interviewee name, and date. If a single transcript, the folder should also list the accession number. Once the collection is processed and transferred items have been delivered to and stored by the AV department, location(s) should be added to the resource record. If an oral history(s) is part of a papers or records collection , the box labels containing recording media will reflect the accession number of the entire collection, and each individual tape should still be labeled with the accession number plus the unique identifier. Description \u00b6 Oral histories should receive the same level of description as do papers and records collections so that they may be discoverable during a search of the Reuther's complete holdings. If an oral history(s) is part of a papers or records collection it should be listed in the box: folder listings either as part of a larger series or its own series (quantity alone may dictate this approach) in Level I or II description; or listed at the end of the box: folder listing in Level III description. All formats (AV and transcript) should be noted either in the series title or after each interview listed. Transcripts and media will need to be listed separately to physically account for all material. If the collection is only being described at the top collection level, the oral history(s) should be mentioned in the abstract and the box inventory, if applicable. All machine-dependent media being physically transferred to the AV Dept. should be noted in the resource record under Separated Material. If an oral history(s) is part of a unique accession or accrual to a unique accession (this includes discrete projects and duplicates) either a new resource record is created or an existing one is amended (for accruals). Size of the accession will dictate whether description is collection level, box level, or folder level. In any case, the name of the interviewees should be noted either in an abstract, scope and content note, or a box or folder listing. All machine-dependent media being physically transferred to the AV Dept. should be noted in the resource record under the Separated Material note. All formats (AV and transcript) should be noted in the abstract and scope & content note, or box or folder listing, depending on level of description (collection vs. item level). Transcripts and media will need to be listed separately to physically account for all material. Unique identifiers for each interview do not need to be recorded in the resource record notes. They will only be accounted for in a box:item inventory, if included. Examples \u00b6 Examples are given to help illustrate above points. Refer to oral history notes in ArchivesSpace: Resource Records for full description procedures. Example 1: In a 5-series manuscript collection, OH material is arranged in the last series (2 boxes) and described. Box 83 contains transcripts that stay with the collection. Box 84 contains tapes physically transferred to the AV Dept. The Separated Material note of the resource record states the transfer: Separated Material Oral history audiotapes (Box 84) were transferred to the AV Dept. The Arrangement note of the resource record states a general description: Arrangement Papers are divided into 5 series: Series V: Linden NJ Plant interviews, 1980s-1990s The inventory states formats of the interviews: Inventory Series V Box 83 1. Bob Jones; transcript, 1988 2. Jim Taylor; transcript, 1985 Box 84 1. Bob Jones; audio cassette tape 1 of 2, 1988 2. Bob Jones; audio cassette tape 2 of 2, 1988 3. Jim Taylor; audio cassette tape, 1985 Example 2: In a records collection, OH transcripts are arranged in the last box and described. A few audiotapes (less than a box) are physically transferred to the AV Dept. The Separated Material note of the resource record states the transfer: Separated Material Oral history audiocassette tapes were transferred to the AV Dept. The Arrangement note of the resource record details how the formats are listed in the inventory: Arrangement Oral history interviews are listed at the end of the inventory (Box 83). Transcripts only can be found in Box 83. Recordings are listed under AV Materials. The inventory states formats of the interviews: Inventory Box 83 1. Publications, 1990-2010 2.

The box: folder listing reflects their order as per normal arrangement & description procedures. Audiotapes (less than one box) are physically transferred to the AV Dept. The Separated Material note in the resource record states the transfer: Separated Material Oral history audiotapes were transferred to the AV Dept. The Arrangement note in the resource record details how the formats are listed in the inventory: Arrangement Oral history transcripts are listed alphabetically. Recordings are listed under AV Material. The inventory states formats of the interviews: Inventory Box 1 1. Bob Jones; transcript, 1988 2. Jim Taylor; transcript, 1985 AV Materials 1.

Jim Taylor; audio cassette tape, 1985 Example 4: In a discrete digital oral history project, transcripts and audio files are uploaded to the server and backed up on the external drives. The Access note reads: Access An audio recording of each interview may be accessed on site at the Reuther Library. The Arrangement note explains the digital file order: Arrangement Oral history interviews are arranged alphabetically, which corresponds to their unique identifier, and then by format. The inventory lists formats of each interview: Inventory LOH001000_OH_001.mp3 Bob Jones; audio recording, 1988 LOH001000_OH_001.pdf Bob Jones; transcript, 1988 LOH001000_OH_001.mp3 Jim Taylor; audio recording, 1985 LOH001000_OH_001.pdf Jim Taylor; transcript, 1985 Newspaper Clippings \u00b6 In large amounts, these present a special problem for the processor. Clippings aren\u2019t prime research material and excessive time should not be devoted to them. For Level I processing: they should be trimmed down as much as possible. No clippings should be photocopied unless they have some real value, or if they are in a deteriorating state. If known, write the name of the newspaper and the date in pencil on the clipping. Segregate the clippings from the rest of the collection, foldering them separately or interleaving acid-free bond paper. Oversize Items \u00b6 Material such as charts, maps, diplomas, and certificates should usually be removed from the main body of the collection. Oversized clippings can be folded to fit in the folders. If it is appropriate, a slip of bond paper with a penciled or typed notation of its disposition should be placed in the folder in which the item would belong if it were not oversized. The items should be unrolled or unfolded and placed in oversized folders labeled, and placed in an oversized box or communal oversized box, depending on quantity. If the item(s) are too big to be housed in an OS box, contact the AV Department for possible storage in a map drawer. Notes should be kept about the existence of these oversized materials so that they can be listed in the finding aid in the following locations: Extent \u2013 separated by comma from the linear feet of manuscript or storage boxes (alternately, if included in total linear footage use a parallel expression in parentheses to note the existence of special-sized material). Related Material \u2013 if items are to be stored in the audiovisual department, indicate their transfer in this section Box/Folder listing \u2013 if items are to be shelved along with the rest of the collection in the main stacks, include a list of their contents in this section, where appropriate (e.g. as part of a series or as their own stand-alone series). Born-Digital Materials \u00b6 Born-digital material may comprise the entire collection or be only a portion of the collection (i.e., a hybrid collection). Additionally, born-digital materials may have been accessioned as such (transferred or directly captured) and already transferred into the Reuther's digital backlog, or born-digital materials such as electronic storage material may be found later during processing. This section provides procedures to accommodate both situations. For hybrid collections, it is ideal for born-digital material to be processed in parallel with paper-based material, with the materials integrated in both description and intellectual arrangement. Electronic Storage Media \u00b6 Material such as hard drives, floppy disks, optical discs (CDs and DVDs), and flash drives should have their contents transferred off of the storage media and evaluated in the same manner as analog material. If the electronic storage media was not transferred during Accessioning: Transfer the digital materials. Obsolete storage media should be discarded post-processing. If the collection is \u201chybrid\u201d (contains both paper and electronic storage media): For small amounts of digital material found within folders, separate it from the body of the collection, noting any accompanying records for context. If appropriate, a slip of bond paper with a penciled or typed notation of its disposition should be placed in the folder in which the item would belong. Electronic media found loose in the collection (i.e., not in a specific folder), treat the same as the paper material, integrating the materials in the intellectual arrangement and description. Proceed to the All Digital Materials section below to create the AIP in Archivematica. All Digital Materials \u00b6 For both electronic media and transferred born digital material, use Archivematica to preserve and create an accessible copy of the digital materials available via ArchivesSpace. At this point, the digital materials were previously transferred into Archivematica.

From the Archivematica website : The first row of the csv file consists of field names. Field names must not include spaces. Dublin Core field names must contain the \u201cdc\u201d element in the name, eg \u201cdc.title\u201d. Note that the Dublin Core is not validated - this is up to the user. Each subsequent row contains the field values for a single directory [e.g., collection, series, or subseries level metadata] or file [i.e., item-level metadata]. As of version 1.4, both directory and object level metadata is allowed in the metadata.csv. For multi-value fields (such as dc.subject), the entire column is repeated and each column contains a single value (i.e. there should be multiple dc.subject columns if there are multiple subject terms). Empty columns can be deleted, if you prefer. If the metadata are for simple objects, the csv file must contain a \u201cfilename\u201d column listing the filepath and filename of each objects: eg \u201cobjects/BrocktonOval.jp2\u201d If the metadata are for compound objects, the \u201cfilename\u201d column is instead called \u201cparts\u201d and contains the names of the directories containing the items that form the compound object (i.e. \u201cobjects/Jan021964\u201d). Note that filenames can be duplicates of filenames in other subdirectories if desired. For example, the name \u201cpage01.jp2\u201d can occur in multiple subdirectories. Fill out the metadata.csv template which provides template text for simple digital objects: Note that metadata is only being added for the archival material and is provided at the folder level. Filename: This is mandatory and lists the file or directory (if providing only collection, series, subseries, etc. metadata) name that is described in the subsequent columns. dc.title: Item-level (or, if describing a directory, the collection, series) metadata, Title of the digital object. dc.coverage: Item-level (or, if describing a directory, the collection, series) metadata, date(s) of creation dc.description: Item-level (or, if describing a directory, the collection, series) metadata, description of item. dc.format: Digital file format (item-level, leave blank for directories) dc.identifier: File name dc.source: Collection-level.

They apply only to born-digital materials or materials digitized prior to accessioning. For paper-based analog materials that are digitized here at the Reuther, follow the naming conventions in How to Digitize Analog Manuscripts and Records . For Serials and Publications Folder Title: Accession Number File Name: AbreviatedTitle_YYYY_v0001_i0001 (where v = volume and i = issue) Examples: Example 1 Folder Title: LR005555 File Name: AmSerEmp_2012_v0020_i0010 (Accession #: LR005555, Publication Title: American Service Employee, Publication Year: 2012, Volume: 20, Issue: 10) Example 2 Folder Title: UR005556 File Name: UrObs_1970_v0001i0103 (Accession #: UR005556, Publication Title: Urban Observer, Publication Year: 1970, Volume: 1, Issue: 103) Library Materials \u00b6 ALUA The following items should remain with ALUA collections: Labor periodicals, newspapers, and newsletters (runs and scattered issues ) Urban-related serials published by organizations whose records we collect (runs and scattered issues) Labor agreements/contracts and supplements (final draft only, and no more than 3 copies) Constitutions and bylaws Convention proceedings Books and other publications with a flat, sewn-in or glued spine Pamphlets, booklets, and other printed material with a folded, stapled spine or spiral binding Publications related to a topic that reflects the interests of the donor Items all related to the same topic, the removal of which would destroy the collected body of information WSU The University Archivist determines the disposition of the following items found in University collections: Annual reports University Council minutes (runs) Board of Governors minutes (runs) Academic Senate minutes (runs) The South End Inside Wayne State Library items should be left as found within the collection (Level III), placed with existing corresponding records series (Level I or II), or grouped together as a library series (Level I or II), depending on the collection. They can be boxed along with non-AV collection materials. Items should be foldered in groups by subject heading rather than individually, whenever possible. Alternately, folder by publication title if amount so warrants (i.e. there is at least one folder). Once the collection is processed, if it contains publications that directly correspond to serial runs already in the library (not duplicates, but missing issues), tag the abstract node and/or the EAD guide with the appropriate format access term. Regardless of level of processing, library materials should be only minimally inventoried. Use of the materials may dictate further processing, such as an inventory by publication title, at a later date. All library items should be listed in the box folder inventory as found in the collection, as placed with existing series or as a library series immediately preceding any audio-visual series, if any. Include necessary information such as subjects, dates, amounts, formats, etc., and titles where applicable (i.e. the folder title is the publication title). Microfilm and Microfiche \u00b6 Microfilm and microfiche are described and the format noted in the finding aid. Microfiche remains physically stored with the collection (stored in a separate folder or box), but microfilm is separated, placed into specialized housing and stored in the reading room microfilm cabinet. Describe microfilm and microfiche in context as it is found in the collection. Where the microfilm or microfiche is a duplicate of paper material, do not describe twice. Place separated microfilm reels in a microfilm box, found in the Audiovisual Department. Like photographs, microfiche in small quantities may be left in its original place in the collection where appropriate. Indicate the presence of microfilm material in the finding aid. Use the \u201cCopies\u201d field to denote that the microfilm is a duplication of other material in the collection (i.e. paper materials). Also indicate which material is the use copy. Use the \u201cRelated Material\u201d field to denote that the microfilm is unique material that has been transferred. List the quantity of microfilm reels in the extent. Transfer microfilm to the microfilm cabinet in the Reuther Library reading room. Assign the reel a location following the last documented reel in the cabinet. This location will begin with 3R-A-2, followed by the microfilm box number (i.e., 3R-A-2(29). Include the microfilm\u2019s location in the collection\u2019s abstract on the Reuther website. Sensitive Materials \u00b6 As much as possible, identify any documents of a very personal nature such as: Personnel or \u201cPersonnel Committee\u201d files, including performance evaluations Student records Grievance files Legal case files Police or prison records Social work case files Medical (including psychiatric) records Military records Financial records Intimate personal correspondence Intimate diary passages Interviews, or any documents that contain statements which may be libelous Decide if items should be discarded, given back to the donor, restricted, or kept in the collection. IF KEPT IN OPEN COLLECTION: Add minimal description in the finding aid (i.e. use general term to encompass several folders or boxes of material instead of listing each folder title). Photocopy anything that might have intrinsic value (e.g., the correspondence of famous people, cartoon drawings) and folder the originals for transfer to the vault. The folder(s) should reference where the copies are (Box:Folder) and completely state the collection title and accession number. The folders are then stored in the available accumulated SB in the vault. Include statement of transfer in the Separated Materials note of the resource record, statement of access in the Access note, and vault shelf location in the abstract node and the Location note of the ArchivesSpace record. Include statement in the box folder list referring researchers to the use restriction statement at the front of the guide (for levels II & III) or indicate whether a Restricted Use Form (generally limited to collections where material may not be quoted or cited; names and other personal information, which might identify an individual, cannot be cited; material is confidential, etc.) should be signed before access is granted. Mark boxes containing restricted material with \u201cRestricted Use\u201d label. IF DISCARDED: Make a listing of items removed from the collection and add it to the case file. Generally, this can be accomplished in the Resource Record Collection Management subrecord. Material should be shredded after the collection is fully arranged and described. IF CLOSED: In cases where portions of the collection are to remain closed for a while, do not list them in the body of your finding aid. Create a Temporarily Closed event linked to the resource record, so these items can be added when opened. Make a separate list that will be kept in the case file.","title":"b.

In order for this to work properly, create one Date subrecord for each distinct individual or range of dates and enter the information in a consistent, standardized way. For example, if an ArchivesSpace component contains materials from August 17, 1945 and 1957-1965, create two separate Date subrecords with the following Expressions: 1945 August 17 : This will be automatically parsed into a Single date with a Begin value of 1945-08-17 1957-1965 : This will be automatically parsed into an Inclusive date with a Begin value of 1957 and an End value of 1965 If exact dates cannot be determined, but approximate dates can be inferred, enter the Date Expression as circa [date] . If no dates can be determined or inferred, enter a Date Expression of undated . Alternatively, for lower-level Archival Objects, do not add any Date subrecords; this will result in ArchivesSpace inheriting down the closest parent record's Date information for display and search in the Public User Interface. For example, an Archival Object with no Date subrecords that is a child of a Sub-Series with a date range of 1950-1970 will have that Date range associated with it.

Archival Objects are arranged in a tree view that represents the relationship of various levels of description to one another (\"the hierarchy\"). General Guidelines \u00b6 All Archival Object must contain the following: Title and/or Date Level of Description (part, Series, Sub-series, File, etc.) An Archival Object corresponding to an actual manifestation of archival materials (e.g., a folder in a box) must have an Instance , either a Container Instance indicating which Top Container (box) materials can be found in or a Digital Object instance with a URL or path to where digital content can be found. Additionally, Archival Objects may have various other elements as needed, including: Notes (Scope and Contents, Conditions Governing Access, Physical Description, etc.) Extents When adding descriptive elements to Archival Objects, adhere to the principle of inheritance: add additional description only if the information is different or more specific than that at a higher level. Date Guidelines \u00b6 The Reuther uses an ArchivesSpace plugin called timewalk , developed by Alexander Duryee at the New York Public Library, to automatically parse Date Expressions into structured Begin and End dates when an ArchivesSpace component is saved. In order for this to work properly, create one Date subrecord for each distinct individual or range of dates and enter the information in a consistent, standardized way. For example, if an ArchivesSpace component contains materials from August 17, 1945 and 1957-1965, create two separate Date subrecords with the following Expressions: 1945 August 17 : This will be automatically parsed into a Single date with a Begin value of 1945-08-17 1957-1965 : This will be automatically parsed into an Inclusive date with a Begin value of 1957 and an End value of 1965 If exact dates cannot be determined, but approximate dates can be inferred, enter the Date Expression as circa [date] . If no dates can be determined or inferred, enter a Date Expression of undated . Alternatively, for lower-level Archival Objects, do not add any Date subrecords; this will result in ArchivesSpace inheriting down the closest parent record's Date information for display and search in the Public User Interface. For example, an Archival Object with no Date subrecords that is a child of a Sub-Series with a date range of 1950-1970 will have that Date range associated with it. At the Resource level, record one Inclusive or Single Date and, if applicable, one Bulk date. At the Archival Object/component level, record as many Inclusive or Single dates as necessary, favoring one or two inclusive ranges when possible, and one Bulk date if applicable. For each date: Select : Add Date or + if necessary to add a new Date subrecord Label : Creation Expression : [Date] Type : Choose one: Inclusive, Single, or Bulk Creating Archival Objects \u00b6 This section describes the process by which individual Archival Objects can be added. Note This process is best suited to occasions when only a few Archival Objects need to be created (e.g., adding just a couple of folders to the arrangement). For adding objects in bulk, refer to the Rapid Data Entry and Spreadsheet Bulk Import guidelines below. New Archival Objects can be added to a Resource as either a \"child\" or a \"sibling,\" which will be used to determine its position in the intellectual arrangement relative to the currently selected Resource or Archival Object. A \"child\" Archival Object will be added one level below the currently selected record Note: All top-level Archival Objects in the arrangement (e.g., part or Series) are \"children\" of the Resource record A \"sibling\" Archival Object will be added at the same level as the currently selected record To create an Archival Object, first select the existing record (Resource or Archival Object) that the new Archival Object will be created in relation to. To add an Archival Object, you must be \"Edit\" mode. If you are not in \"Edit\" mode, click the \"Edit\" button at the top left of the Resource or Archival Object. If the existing record is a Resource, only the \"Add Child\" button will be available: If the existing record is an Archival Object, both \"Add Child\" and \"Add Sibling\" buttons will be available: The new Archival Object will be created and you will be redirected to the blank Archival Object record. Rapid Data Entry \u00b6 ArchivesSpace's Rapid Data Entry (RDE) feature can be used to create many Archival Objects at the same level in a more efficient way than creating them one-by-one as described above. Note that RDE can only be used to add \"child\" level Archival Objects to a given record. As such, RDE will often need to be paired with some individual Archival Object creation. A common workflow might involve manually creating a Series-level Archival Object and then using RDE to add the folder listing associated with that Series-level object. Note RDE is best suited to creating a small-to-medium number of Archival Objects as children of a single record at one time. Do not attempt to use RDE to create dozens and dozens of Archival Objects at once, as you may lose your work due to a number of technical errors. RDE will also not allow you to create multiple levels of description at once. To create many Archival Objects at once, especially when creating multiple levels of description, refer to the Spreadsheet Bulk Import guidelines below. To use Rapid Data Entry, select the Archival Object to which you would like to add child-level records and click the \"Rapid Data Entry\" button. In the above example, all Archival Objects created via RDE will be added as children of the \"Series IV: New Series\" record. After clicking the \"Rapid Data Entry\" button, the Rapid Data Entry form will pop up. The default form includes a row per Archival Object with columns for many of the elements that can possibly be added to an Archival Object. To add more Archival Object ros to the form, click the \"Add Row\" button or, to add many rows at once, click the down arrow next to the button, enter the desired number of rows, and click \"Add Rows.\" Rapid Data Entry has many built-in features to make the use of RDE easier and more efficient, described below. Sticky Columns \u00b6 Columns in RDE can be \"stickied,\" or made to repeat the same information in that column for each newly added row. Sticky columns are highlighted in blue. To sticky or unsticky a column, click the column name. Useful columns to sticky and their common values include: Level of Description (File) Publish (Checked) Date Label (Creation) Date Type (Inclusive Dates) Instance Type (Mixed Materials) Container Type (Box) Child Type (Folder) Note that information in stickied columns can be edited for each newly created row -- if a column almost but not always has a particular value, it is still likely easiest to sticky its value and change it only on the rows where it is necessary to do so. Show/Hide Columns \u00b6 The default RDE form has more columns than should ever be used. Unused columns can be hidden by clicking the \"Columns: 33 visible\" drop down and unchecking columns that are not needed. Generally not needed columns include: Basic Information - Other Level Basic Information - Component Unique Identifier Language - Language Language - Script Instance - Grandchild Type Instance - Grandchild Indicator Reorder Columns \u00b6 The columns in the RDE form may not be ordered in a way that promotes ease-of-use. Some of the columns that show up on the left side may be infrequently used, and those that show up on the right side (requiring horizontal scrolling) may be frequently used. Click the \"Reorder Columns\" button to move infrequently used columns down and more frequently used columns up. A common use case for this might be making instance/container columns more readily available at the expense of extent columns. Templates \u00b6 One of the most useful features of RDE is the ability to save and load RDE Templates. For most typical operations, the same columns will be stickied, hidden, and reordered. For those cases, the form configuration can be saved as a template and loaded on each subsequent. As an example, the Reuther's ArchivesSpace instance has an \"Inventory\" template, shown below: This template includes only those columns required to create a folder listing consisting of titles, dates, containers, and one note. Please note that templates are shared among all users of the ArchivesSpace application. Do not edit or delete a template that you have not created, but do always feel free to save a new template that meets your needs. Validate and Save Rows \u00b6 The \"Validate Rows\" button at the bottom left of the RDE form should be clicked prior to clicking the \"Save Rows\" button. Row validation will ensure that each of the rows that have been created have the required information to successfully create an Archival Object. Validate rows until any/all errors have been resolved. Warning The RDE form will not save your work as you are going. You cannot close out of the pop up window and come back later to continue, and if you are logged out of the application prior to clicking Save Rows your work may be lost. Do not wait until you have created dozens of rows to save. Save early, and save often. Spreadsheet Bulk Import \u00b6 ArchivesSpace has the ability to import an Excel spreadsheet, created according to a predefined template, to create many Archival Objects at one time. Note Spreadsheet Bulk Import is useful for creating many Archival Objects associated with a Resource at once, especially when there are multiple levels of description involved. A common use case for Spreadsheet Bulk Import is creating an inventory for a large collection with many boxes and folders. It is often not the most efficient method for creating individual Archival Objects (see creating Archival Objects ) or for adding a handful of Archival Objects at the same level (see Rapid Data Entry ). To create an inventory in bulk using the spreadsheet importer, first download the ArchivesSpace bulk import template Save the template to your computer or OneDrive and rename it according the the accession number. The template contains four rows with field codes and mapping information. Do not edit the contents of any of the first four rows. Each row following the mapping/field code rows will create one Archival Object in sequential order. Most columns in the spreadsheet are self-explanatory and mirror the fields described in the Creating Archival Objects and Rapid Data Entry sections above. There are, however, a few particular aspects of the spreadsheet that warrant further explanation, indicated below by their corresponding ArchivesSpace field code (row 3): ead: The ead column must exactly match the Resource-level EAD ID (which should itself match the accession numnber). This is how the spreadsheet importer ensures that the spreadsheet being imported contains Archival Objects intended for the selected Resource. hierarchy : The hiearchy column is used to specify the hierarchical relationship of the Archival Objects within the spreadsheet. Rows with a hierarchy of 1 will be added at the first level (e.g., a series). Rows that follow that row with a hierarchy of 2 will be added at the second level, as children of the hierarchy 1 row (e.g., a sub-series) until the next hierarchy 1 row. Rows with a hierarchy of 3 following the hierarchy 2 rows will be added as children of the preceeding hierarchy 2 row, and so on. To illustrate this, the contents of the following table would result in the ArchivesSpace hierarchy in the proceeding image. title expression hierarchy level Series 1: Personal materials 1 Series Correspondence 2 Sub-series 1990-1995 3 File 1995-2000 3 File Biographical materials 2 Sub-series Awards and certificates 3 File Degrees 3 File Series 2: Professional career 1 Series Affiliations 2 Sub-series An organization 3 File Another organization 3 File Please note that the spreadsheet import template has many more fields than will generally be used for each Archival Object. Refer to the General Guidelines above for information about required and optional elements for Archival Objects. Also note that there are likely some descriptive elements that may be easier to add within ArchivesSpace itself after importing a spreadsheet than in the spreadsheet itself. For example, it may be easier to add a series-level Scope and Content note within ArchivesSpace after importing a spreadsheet than to write it in the n_scopecontent cell for the series. When you have finished creating a spreadsheet inventory, import it into ArchivesSpace by entering edit mode on the relevant Resource record, clicking the \"Load via Spreadsheet\" button, and selecting the correct spreadsheet from your computer. If you have any questions about the use of the ArchivesSpace spreadsheet importer, please consult with the Technical Services Archivist. EAD Inventories for ArchivesSpace \u00b6 Note The method described below will be phased out in favor of the Spreadsheet Bulk Import method described above To most efficiently enter inventories for newly processed collections into ArchivesSpace, begin by typing the Box:folder list into the Excel inventory template , separate from the collection level description already entered directly into ArchivesSpace. After completing the inventory in Excel, hidden columns are unhidden and the entire sheet is copied and pasted into the EAD inventory template . Mandatory tags in the EAD are completed, the EAD inventory only file is saved, and then imported into ArchivesSpace, creating an inventory only resource record. The inventory only resource record is merged into the description resource record, creating a complete resource record containing the collection\u2019s description and inventory. This process can be used for first time inventories as well as adding an inventory for an accrual or addition. An inventory-only resource record that is merged into a resource record with an existing inventory, is added to the end of the current existing inventory. Therefore, any subsequent inventory is simply added to the end of the current box-folder list. These instructions are specific to the EAD \u2013 All levels Template, but the same principals can be applied to any of the templates in the Excel inventory template . Create Inventory in Excel \u00b6 Open the Excel inventory template and save it as [Accession#]_Inv.xlsx. Select the Sheet that best fits your arrangement : EAD \u2013 All levels (part, series, subseries, file), Series + Sub (series, subseries, file), Series (series and file only), File Only (collection level arrangement- a box/folder list). Add and/or remove Parts, Series, and Subseries headings (ensuring that titles are included for any series and subseries), in column B to reflect the collection inventory. Delete any example headings if they do not apply to your collection. Note that if this is an additional part, the series numbering continues from the previous part. For each Box : Insert the required number of rows within the appropriate Series (alternatively Subseries or Parts), to reflect the number of folders in a box. Note If your folder numbering in a legacy Word guide has number range bullets (e.g. 5-10. Correspondence), you will only need to add one row in Excel. Input the Box number in the first row beneath the heading, in column G (D in File Only). Move your cursor over the bottom right corner of that cell until you see a black plus sign. Click and drag down through all the rows for that box to copy the box number to all the rows. For any instances of a box title only being listed (rather than folders/items in the box), delete the <container type=\u201dFolder\u201d> following </container> tags (rows I \u2013 K, except in the File Only template, rows F \u2013 H) Input the folder numbers . In column J (G in File Only), insert the number \u201c1\u201d for the first folder in the box (see example in the template). Move your cursor over the bottom right corner of the cell until you see a black plus sign. Click and drag down through all the rows for that box. If this populates all those cells with the number \u201c1\u201d, click on the pop-up button and choose the bullet next to Fill Series . This will auto-populate your folder numbers. If materials in the box are not stored in folders, (i.e., scrapbooks, tapes, realia), change container type from \u201cFolder\u201d to \u201cItem,\u201d (e.g., <container type=\u201dItem\u201d> ). Input the folder titles . Note Do NOT use special characters or ampersands (i.e., &) as they will not import correctly into ASpace. For new box:folder lists , simply type in the folder titles in column M (J in File Only), next to the corresponding folder number. Copy EAD tags in Excel . Select all cells and choose Column>Unhide from the Format menu. The EAD tagging structure will now be visible under Box 1, in the same row as Folder 1. Ensure the numbering of all your <c> level tags are correct: If you have parts: <c01> = Part, <c02> = Series, <c03> = Subseries, <c04> = File OR <c01> = Part, <c02> = Series, <c03> = File OR <c01> = Part, <c02> = File If you have Series: <c01> = Series, <c02> = Subseries, <c03> = File OR <c01> Series, <c02> = File If you have no Series: <c01> = File Note Note that these may vary throughout the document, (e.g., if Series 1 has subseries, file = <c04> , and if Series 2 does not have subseries, file = <c03> ). Update all <c> tags for levels Parts, Series, and Subseries (all that are applicable) found in column A and File level tags found in columns D and P (columns A and M in File Only).

Additionally, Archival Objects may have various other elements as needed, including: Notes (Scope and Contents, Conditions Governing Access, Physical Description, etc.) Extents When adding descriptive elements to Archival Objects, adhere to the principle of inheritance: add additional description only if the information is different or more specific than that at a higher level.","title":"General Guidelines"},{"location":"02_arrangement/02_04_archival_objects/#date-guidelines","text":"The Reuther uses an ArchivesSpace plugin called timewalk , developed by Alexander Duryee at the New York Public Library, to automatically parse Date Expressions into structured Begin and End dates when an ArchivesSpace component is saved. In order for this to work properly, create one Date subrecord for each distinct individual or range of dates and enter the information in a consistent, standardized way. For example, if an ArchivesSpace component contains materials from August 17, 1945 and 1957-1965, create two separate Date subrecords with the following Expressions: 1945 August 17 : This will be automatically parsed into a Single date with a Begin value of 1945-08-17 1957-1965 : This will be automatically parsed into an Inclusive date with a Begin value of 1957 and an End value of 1965 If exact dates cannot be determined, but approximate dates can be inferred, enter the Date Expression as circa [date] . If no dates can be determined or inferred, enter a Date Expression of undated . Alternatively, for lower-level Archival Objects, do not add any Date subrecords; this will result in ArchivesSpace inheriting down the closest parent record's Date information for display and search in the Public User Interface. For example, an Archival Object with no Date subrecords that is a child of a Sub-Series with a date range of 1950-1970 will have that Date range associated with it. At the Resource level, record one Inclusive or Single Date and, if applicable, one Bulk date.

Note that RDE can only be used to add \"child\" level Archival Objects to a given record. As such, RDE will often need to be paired with some individual Archival Object creation. A common workflow might involve manually creating a Series-level Archival Object and then using RDE to add the folder listing associated with that Series-level object. Note RDE is best suited to creating a small-to-medium number of Archival Objects as children of a single record at one time. Do not attempt to use RDE to create dozens and dozens of Archival Objects at once, as you may lose your work due to a number of technical errors. RDE will also not allow you to create multiple levels of description at once. To create many Archival Objects at once, especially when creating multiple levels of description, refer to the Spreadsheet Bulk Import guidelines below. To use Rapid Data Entry, select the Archival Object to which you would like to add child-level records and click the \"Rapid Data Entry\" button. In the above example, all Archival Objects created via RDE will be added as children of the \"Series IV: New Series\" record.

Note Spreadsheet Bulk Import is useful for creating many Archival Objects associated with a Resource at once, especially when there are multiple levels of description involved. A common use case for Spreadsheet Bulk Import is creating an inventory for a large collection with many boxes and folders. It is often not the most efficient method for creating individual Archival Objects (see creating Archival Objects ) or for adding a handful of Archival Objects at the same level (see Rapid Data Entry ). To create an inventory in bulk using the spreadsheet importer, first download the ArchivesSpace bulk import template Save the template to your computer or OneDrive and rename it according the the accession number. The template contains four rows with field codes and mapping information. Do not edit the contents of any of the first four rows. Each row following the mapping/field code rows will create one Archival Object in sequential order. Most columns in the spreadsheet are self-explanatory and mirror the fields described in the Creating Archival Objects and Rapid Data Entry sections above. There are, however, a few particular aspects of the spreadsheet that warrant further explanation, indicated below by their corresponding ArchivesSpace field code (row 3): ead: The ead column must exactly match the Resource-level EAD ID (which should itself match the accession numnber). This is how the spreadsheet importer ensures that the spreadsheet being imported contains Archival Objects intended for the selected Resource. hierarchy : The hiearchy column is used to specify the hierarchical relationship of the Archival Objects within the spreadsheet. Rows with a hierarchy of 1 will be added at the first level (e.g., a series). Rows that follow that row with a hierarchy of 2 will be added at the second level, as children of the hierarchy 1 row (e.g., a sub-series) until the next hierarchy 1 row. Rows with a hierarchy of 3 following the hierarchy 2 rows will be added as children of the preceeding hierarchy 2 row, and so on. To illustrate this, the contents of the following table would result in the ArchivesSpace hierarchy in the proceeding image. title expression hierarchy level Series 1: Personal materials 1 Series Correspondence 2 Sub-series 1990-1995 3 File 1995-2000 3 File Biographical materials 2 Sub-series Awards and certificates 3 File Degrees 3 File Series 2: Professional career 1 Series Affiliations 2 Sub-series An organization 3 File Another organization 3 File Please note that the spreadsheet import template has many more fields than will generally be used for each Archival Object. Refer to the General Guidelines above for information about required and optional elements for Archival Objects. Also note that there are likely some descriptive elements that may be easier to add within ArchivesSpace itself after importing a spreadsheet than in the spreadsheet itself. For example, it may be easier to add a series-level Scope and Content note within ArchivesSpace after importing a spreadsheet than to write it in the n_scopecontent cell for the series. When you have finished creating a spreadsheet inventory, import it into ArchivesSpace by entering edit mode on the relevant Resource record, clicking the \"Load via Spreadsheet\" button, and selecting the correct spreadsheet from your computer.

The following content guidelines are based on a combination of DACS and local practice -- where applicable, a link is provided to the DACS guidelines for a particular element. The usage of the following note types will differ depending on the level of description -- many note types are required at the collection-level, and either optional or unused throughout the inventory. Refer to level-specific guidelines for Resources notes and Archival Object notes for further instruction. ArchivesSpace has several note types that are not detailed below. Do not use note types that are not detailed below. Consult with the Technical Services Archivist if information needs to be recorded that does not fit into any of the below note guidelines. Abstract \u00b6 DACS : n/a Collection-level : Required Component-level : Unused Content Guidelines Abstract notes are brief statements that includes high-level descriptive information for an entire collection. It should include the most important information from the Biographical/Historical note and Scope and Contents note. A typical abstract will be between a few sentences to a paragraph long. Examples Biographical/Historical \u00b6 DACS : 2.7 Collection-level : Levels 1 and 2 required, Level 3 optional Component-level : Generally unused Content Guidelines Biographical/Historical notes are a short narrative biography of the person or history of the corporate entity that created or collected the materials being described. The purpose of this note is to provide the researcher with pertinent information about the creator of the materials being decribed in order to place the manuscript materials or records in their proper context. Particular attention should be given to aspects of the creator's biography/history that are best represented in the collection of materials being described. Examples Scope and Contents \u00b6 DACS : 3.1 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Series-level optimal, lower-level optional/generally unused Content Guidelines Scope and Contents notes provide information about the nature of materials being described so that researchers may judge the potential relevance of the materials for their research needs. Scope and Contents notes may include information about the functions or activities represented in the materials, the subject matter documented in the materials, the persons or corporate entities present in the materials, the dates or time periods covered by the materials, and information about the material types or documentary forms present in the collection. The collection-level Scope and Contents note should describe the collection as a whole. Scope and Contents notes at lower levels, such as at the series level, should describe that particular aggregate in greater detail. Examples Conditions Governing Access \u00b6 DACS : 4.1 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Optional Content Guidelines Conditions Governing Access notes contain a succinct statement regarding any access restrictions to the materials being described. Access resrictions may be the result of agreements with the donor, institutional policy, or the sensitive nature of the materials. The note should specify the details of the restriction, indicate the specific materials to which the restriction applies (e.g., the entire collection, a particular series, a particular box, etc.) and, if applicable, the duration of the restriction or the date on which the restriction will be lifted. Examples Collection is open for research. Conditions Governing Use \u00b6 DACS : 4.4 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Optional Content Guidelines Conditions Governing Use notes detail any restrictions on reproduction or publication after access to materials has been granted due to copyright, donor agreement, or other reasons. The Reuther has drafted several boilerplate statements to be used with collections of different processing levels and/or those that include oral histories, listed below. Use the appropriate statement and add any additional restrictions specific to that collection, if any apply. Boilerplate Text Use Text Level 1 Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library <title render=\"doublequote\"> Rules for Use of Archival Materials </title> . Levels 2 and 3 Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library <title render=\"doublequote\"> Rules for Use of Archival Materials </title> . Restrictions: Researchers may encounter records of a sensitive nature \u2013 personnel files, case records and those involving investigations, legal and other private matters. Privacy laws and restrictions imposed by the Library prohibit the use of names and other personal information which might identify an individual, except with written permission from the Director and/or the donor. Oral Histories RESTRICTIONS: Due to the personal nature of oral history, the Library prohibits use of the material in any way that infringes on individual right to privacy, or results in libelous statements or slander, in accordance with U.S. law. Examples Physical Location \u00b6 DACS : 4.2.6 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Unused Note Our current use of Physical Location notes differs from their intended use and will eventually be replaced with ArchivesSpace Top Container/Location management functionality Content Guidelines Physical Location notes provide information about the location of the materials being described if that location affects access to those materials. The Reuther currently uses collection-level Physical Location notes to record the stacks location(s) of the materials. Ensure that the collection-level Physical Location note is unpublished . Examples Immediate Source of Acquisition \u00b6 DACS : 5.2 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Unused Content Guidelines Immediate Source of Acquisiton notes indicate the person or corporate body from which the Reuther received the collection and the date on which it was received. Boilerplate Language The [collection title] were donated to the Walter P. Reuther Library in [date] by [donor]. Examples Processing Information \u00b6 DACS : 7.1.8 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Unused Content Guidelines Processing Information notes contain information about the actions taken by the archivist in processing the materials or about conventions in the finding aid that might impact a researcher's interpretation of the records or understanding of information provided in the finding aid. Actions taken that may be described in the Processing Information note include weeding, alteration of original order, devising of titles, or maintenance actions that result in modifications to previously published description, container numbers, accession numbers, etc. At a minimum, the Reuther uses the below boilerplate language to identify the name of the processing archivist if known and the time period in which the collection was processed. Boilerplate Language Processed and finding aid written by [Walter P. Reuther Library] on [Month Day, Year]. Examples Arrangement \u00b6 DACS : 3.2 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Unused Content Guidelines Arrangement notes describe the current organization of the collection. The note should typically contain the number of parts and the number of series and the names of each series. The note may also provide additional information to describe the arrangement of materials within a given aggregation, such as alphabetically, chronologically, etc. The Reuther uses several boilerplate statements for Arrangement notes that should generally correspond to the level at which the collection was processed. Refer to the boilerplate statements below and make any modifications as necessary. If material is a single oral history transcript, the Arrangement note should read: \u201cTranscript arranged alphabetically by surname with other individual oral history transcripts at the Walter P. Reuther Library.\u201d Boilerplate Language Level Text Level 1 Arranged in [##] series \u2013 Series 1 (Box [#]), Series 2 (Box [##-##]) and Series 3 (Box [##-##]). Folders are arranged [alphabetically, chronologically, in original order, etc.]. [Additional arrangement description, if needed]. Level 2 The collection is arranged into [#] series. Folders in each series are simply listed by their location within each box. They are not arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout several boxes within each series. Series 1: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series 2: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series 3: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series [#]: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Level 3 Folders are listed by their location within each box. They are not necessarily arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout the entire collection.] Examples Preferred Citation \u00b6 DACS : 7.1.5 Resource-level : Required Component-level : Unused Content Guidelines Preferred Citation notes indicate the preferred citation style for researchers to use when citing the Reuther's collections. The note should read as follows for all collections (replacing [Collection Name] with the actual title of the collection): \u201c[Collection Name], Box [#], Folder [#], Walter P.

Generally, Instances are added at the lowest level of description -- that is, to the level of description that corresponds to manifestations of the materials being described. Adding Instances \u00b6 Instances can be added by clicking the \"Add Container Instance\" or \"Add Digital Object\" button as appropriate within the Instances sub-record of an Accession, Resource, or Archival Object. Note Instances will generally only be added to Archival Objects, not Resources or Accessions. Exceptions include collections for which only Resource-level description exists. Container Instances \u00b6 Container Instances are used to identify the physical container in which materials are located. Generally, this will be something like \"Box 1,\" \"Box 2,\" \"Folder 12,\" etc. Instance Type \u00b6 Container Instances require an Instance Type, selected from a controlled value list drop down menu. This should almost always be Mixed Materials, but can be a more specific material type if known (e.g., Audio, Text, etc.) Instance Type is not the ideal place to indicate this information, however, and this information should generally be indicated elsewhere (in an Extent sub-record, a Physical Description note, etc.) Top Container \u00b6 Container Instances require a linked Top Container record. Top Containers are standalone record-types in ArchivesSpace that can be linked to from one or more Accessions, Resources, or Archival Objects. In this way, Top Containers are similar to Agent and Subject records -- they provide a method for managing the same entity in one record and linking to it where necessary. This allows for many collection management activities to be undertaken in ArchivesSpace -- containers can be barcoded, locations can be managed, boxes can be renumbered, and so on. Therefore, it is important that you create and link to the appropriate Top Container record within Container Instances. Avoid creating duplicate Top Container records. Top Containers will generally be unique to a given Resource and will be numbered sequentially beginning with 1. In some cases, a Top Container may be shared between Resource (e.g., a single box that holds several small collections) Creating a Top Container \u00b6 Top Containers need only be created once for each distinct Top Container. To create a Top Container, click the down arrow next to the Top Container field in the Container Instance sub-record and select \"Create.\" A blank Top Container template will appear. Enter the following information: Container Type : Box, Folder, Volume, etc. Indicator : The container number (1, 2, 3... 54, 55, etc.) Then click the \"Create and Link to Top Container\" button Linking a Top Container \u00b6 Once a Top Container has been created, it should then be linked to all subsequent Container Instances to which it applies. To link an existing Top Container record, search in the Top Container search box within the Container Instance for the container type and number and select the appropriate container from the displayed results. Child Containers \u00b6 Child containers are used within Container Instances to indicate second-level containers in which the material being described is located. Child containers will most commonly be used for indicating specific folders within boxes, but may also be used to indicate individual items, volumes, audio cassettes, and so on. Child containers require the following information: Child Type : Folder, Item, etc. Child Indicator : The child container number (1, 2, 3, etc.). If describing multiple folders at once, this can also be a range of numbers (e.g., 3-7) ArchivesSpace allows for adding grandchild containers to describe yet another level of container-within-container; these will rarely be used. Digital Object Instances \u00b6 Digital Object Instances are used to associate links to digital content (e.g., a digitized PDF or image on the Reuther's file server, digital materials in WSULS Digital Collections, an archived website in Archive-It, etc.). Digital Object Instances require a linked Digital Object record, of which the Reuther uses a minimal implementation to effectively create a link from an Archival Object to its online manifestation. Note When adding Digital Object instances for digitized materials, ensure that a Resource-level Existence and Location of Copies note has been added. Creating a Digital Object \u00b6 To create and associate a Digital Object with its relevant Archival Object, first click the \"Add Digital Object\" button in the Instances subrecord, then click the down arrow next to the Digital Object search box and select \"Create.\" A blank Digital Object template will appear. The Digital Object template features many of the same metadata fields as an Archival Object. Resist the temptation to use as many of the fields as possible and instead add only the following, clicking the \"Create and Link to Digital Object\" button when finished: Basic Information \u00b6 Title : Copy and paste the Archival Object display string (title and dates) and, for now, append (Digital) to the title. Identifier : A Digital Object record requires a unique identifier. For simplicity's sake, copy and paste the Digital Object URL as the Identifier. Alternatively, for digitized materials named according to the Reuther's filenaming conventions, you may use the Digital Object's filename (without the file extension). Digital objects created through automated processes may use a randomly generated UUID. File Versions \u00b6 File Versions subrecords are where links to Digital Objects are maintained. The first File Version is the link that will appear on the ArchivesSpace Public User Interface, so ensure that a File Version with the correct link to the item is added. To begin, click the \"Add File Version\" button. File URI : Enter the link to the digital object Publish? : Check the Publish? box to ensure that the link displays on the PUI Do not add any additional information at this time. It is possible that the Reuther will make use of multiple File Versions in the future (e.g., to account for preservation and access copies), at which time additional fields may be used and this documentation will be updated.

In order for this to work properly, create one Date subrecord for each distinct individual or range of dates and enter the information in a consistent, standardized way. For example, if an ArchivesSpace component contains materials from August 17, 1945 and 1957-1965, create two separate Date subrecords with the following Expressions: 1945 August 17 : This will be automatically parsed into a Single date with a Begin value of 1945-08-17 1957-1965 : This will be automatically parsed into an Inclusive date with a Begin value of 1957 and an End value of 1965 If exact dates cannot be determined, but approximate dates can be inferred, enter the Date Expression as circa [date] . If no dates can be determined or inferred, enter a Date Expression of undated . Alternatively, for lower-level Archival Objects, do not add any Date subrecords; this will result in ArchivesSpace inheriting down the closest parent record's Date information for display and search in the Public User Interface.
