# ArchivesSpace: Agent and Subject Records

Agent and subject records are defined in their subsections below.

Agents and Subjects in ASpace can be created two ways:

1.  Use the Create menu. Select: Create > [Agent/Subject] Record. An
    empty agent or subject record will appear. Fill in and edit the
    fields as indicated below.
2.  Create an agent or subject record from within an Accession or
    Resource record
    1.  Select: Add in the [Agent/Subject] subrecord
    2.  An empty [Agent/Subject] subrecord will appear. Fill in and
        edit the fields as indicated below.

The Agent or Subject record will contain more fields than those listed
below, but **do NOT enter/change any information in a field that is not
indicated below.**

Edit the information in [ ]s (and delete the brackets). Choose the
proper selection from those listed in *italics*.

The instructions below can be used both for creating and editing agent
and subject records.

## Agents

**Agents** are created and/or selected for all accessions and resources.
This is where the creator's authority information is captured. The
authority name is the [Library of
Congress](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) Name Authority
(lcna, i.e., NACO) or if the name does not exist, create one following
DACS. The creator's authority name may differ from its common name. For
example, UAW is commonly known as UAW, but it's authorized name heading
is "International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural
Implement Workers of America." **Use the name authority for the agent.**

Adding agents within the resource or accession record:

1.  **Role**: Creator, Source, Subject. Select "Creator" if the agent
    generated the collection, "Source" if the material was donated by
    someone other than the record generator and select "Subject" for
    individuals or organizations represented in the subject contents of
    the collection.
2.  **Agent**: Enter the agent name by typing it into the field or
    selecting "Browse" or "Create" from the dropdown.
    1.  **Browse**: From the dropdown, select "Browse." Search for the
        agent using the box in the upper left, use the list to browse
        for the box, and/or use the facets listed on the left to narrow
        your search. After selecting the agent, select "Link to Agents."
