# Note Guidelines
This page contains content guidelines for notes used throughout various levels of description at the Reuther. The following content guidelines are based on a combination of DACS and local practice -- where applicable, a link is provided to the DACS guidelines for a particular element. 

The usage of the following note types will differ depending on the level of description -- many note types are required at the collection-level, and either optional or unused throughout the inventory. Refer to level-specific guidelines for Resources notes and Archival Object notes for further instruction.

ArchivesSpace has several note types that are not detailed below. **Do not** use note types that are not detailed below. Consult with the Technical Services Archivist if information needs to be recorded that does not fit into any of the below note guidelines.

## Abstract
*DACS*: n/a  
*Collection-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Abstract notes are brief statements that includes high-level descriptive information for an entire collection. It should include the most important information from the [Biographical/Historical](#biographicalhistorical) note and [Scope and Contents](#scope-and-contents) note. A typical abstract will be between a few sentences to a paragraph long.

**Examples**


## Biographical/Historical
*DACS*: [2.7](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/07_administrative_biographical_history.html)  
*Collection-level*: Levels 1 and 2 required, Level 3 optional  
*Component-level*: Generally unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Biographical/Historical notes are a short narrative biography of the person or history of the corporate entity that created or collected the materials being described.

The purpose of this note is to provide the researcher with pertinent information about the creator of the materials being decribed in order to place the manuscript materials or records in their proper context. Particular attention should be given to aspects of the creator's biography/history that are best represented in the collection of materials being described.

**Examples**

## Scope and Contents
*DACS*: [3.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/04_chapter_03/01_scope_and_content.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Series-level optimal, lower-level optional/generally unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Scope and Contents notes provide information about the nature of materials being described so that researchers may judge the potential relevance of the materials for their research needs. Scope and Contents notes may include information about the functions or activities represented in the materials, the subject matter documented in the materials, the persons or corporate entities present in the materials, the dates or time periods covered by the materials, and information about the material types or documentary forms present in the collection.

The collection-level Scope and Contents note should describe the collection as a whole. Scope and Contents notes at lower levels, such as at the series level, should describe that particular aggregate in greater detail.

**Examples**

## Conditions Governing Access
*DACS*: [4.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/01_conditions_governing_access.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Optional  

**Content Guidelines**

Conditions Governing Access notes contain a succinct statement regarding any access restrictions to the materials being described. Access resrictions may be the result of agreements with the donor, institutional policy, or the sensitive nature of the materials. The note should specify the details of the restriction, indicate the specific materials to which the restriction applies (e.g., the entire collection, a particular series, a particular box, etc.) and, if applicable, the duration of the restriction or the date on which the restriction will be lifted.

**Examples**

Collection is open for research.

## Conditions Governing Use
*DACS*: [4.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/04_conditions_governing_reproduction_and_use.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Optional  

**Content Guidelines**

Conditions Governing Use notes detail any restrictions on reproduction or publication after access to materials has been granted due to copyright, donor agreement, or other reasons. 

The Reuther has drafted several boilerplate statements to be used with collections of different processing levels and/or those that include oral histories, listed below. Use the appropriate statement and add any additional restrictions specific to that collection, if any apply.


**Boilerplate Text**


| Use | Text |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library `<title render="doublequote">`Rules for Use of Archival Materials`</title>`. |
| Levels 2 and 3 | Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library `<title render="doublequote">`Rules for Use of Archival Materials`</title>`. Restrictions: Researchers may encounter records of a sensitive nature – personnel files, case records and those involving investigations, legal and other private matters. Privacy laws and restrictions imposed by the Library prohibit the use of names and other personal information which might identify an individual, except with written permission from the Director and/or the donor. |
| Oral Histories| RESTRICTIONS: Due to the personal nature of oral history, the Library prohibits use of the material in any way that infringes on individual right to privacy, or results in libelous statements or slander, in accordance with U.S. law. |

**Examples**

## Physical Location
*DACS*: [4.2.6](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/02_physical_access.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Unused  


!!! note
    Our current use of Physical Location notes differs from their intended use and will eventually be replaced with ArchivesSpace Top Container/Location management functionality 

**Content Guidelines**

Physical Location notes provide information about the location of the materials being described if that location affects access to those materials.

The Reuther currently uses collection-level Physical Location notes to record the stacks location(s) of the materials. Ensure that the collection-level Physical Location note is **unpublished**.

**Examples**

## Immediate Source of Acquisition
*DACS*: [5.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/06_chapter_05/02_immediate_source_of_acquisition.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Immediate Source of Acquisiton notes indicate the person or corporate body from which the Reuther received the collection and the date on which it was received.

**Boilerplate Language**

The [collection title] were donated to the Walter P. Reuther Library in [date] by [donor].

**Examples**

## Processing Information
*DACS*: [7.1.8](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/08_chapter_07/01_notes.html#processing-information)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Processing Information notes contain information about the actions taken by the archivist in processing the materials or about conventions in the finding aid that might impact a researcher's interpretation of the records or understanding of information provided in the finding aid. Actions taken that may be described in the Processing Information note include weeding, alteration of original order, devising of titles, or maintenance actions that result in modifications to previously published description, container numbers, accession numbers, etc.

At a minimum, the Reuther uses the below boilerplate language to identify the name of the processing archivist if known and the time period in which the collection was processed.

**Boilerplate Language**

Processed and finding aid written by [Walter P. Reuther Library] on [Month Day, Year].

**Examples**

## Arrangement
*DACS*: [3.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/04_chapter_03/02_system_of_arrangement.html)  
*Resource-level*: Required  
*Component-level*: Unused  

**Content Guidelines**

Arrangement notes describe the current organization of the collection. The note should typically contain the number of parts and the number of series and the names of each series. The note may also provide additional information to describe the arrangement of materials within a given aggregation, such as alphabetically, chronologically, etc.

The Reuther uses several boilerplate statements for Arrangement notes that should generally correspond to the level at which the collection was processed. Refer to the boilerplate statements below and make any modifications as necessary.

If material is a single oral history transcript, the Arrangement note should read: “Transcript arranged alphabetically by surname with other individual oral history transcripts at the Walter P. Reuther Library.”

**Boilerplate Language**

| Level | Text |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Arranged in [##] series – Series 1 (Box [#]), Series 2 (Box [##-##]) and Series 3 (Box [##-##]). Folders are arranged [alphabetically, chronologically, in original order, etc.]. [Additional arrangement description, if needed]. |
| Level 2 | The collection is arranged into [#] series.  Folders in each series are simply listed by their location within each box. They are not arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout several boxes within each series. Series 1: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series 2: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series 3: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] Series [#]: [Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#)] |
| Level 3 | Folders are listed by their location within each box. They are not necessarily arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout the entire collection.] |
