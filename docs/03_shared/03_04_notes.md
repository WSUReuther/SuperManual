# Note Guidelines

This page contains content guidelines for notes used throughout various levels of description at the Reuther. The following content guidelines are based on a combination of DACS and local practice -- where applicable, a link is provided to the DACS guidelines for a particular element.

The use of note types will differ depending on the level of description — many note types are required at the collection level but are either optional or unused in the inventory. Refer to level-specific guidelines for Resources notes and Archival Object notes for further instruction.

ArchivesSpace has several note types that are not detailed below. **Do not** use note types that are not detailed below. Consult with the Collections Committee if information needs to be recorded that does not fit into any of the note guidelines below.

## Abstract

*DACS*: n/a
*Collection-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Unused

**Content Guidelines**

An abstract note is a brief statement of high-level descriptive information for an entire collection. It should include the most important information from the
[Biographical/Historical](#biographicalhistorical) note and [Scope and Contents](#scope-and-contents) note. A typical abstract will be between a few sentences to a paragraph long.

## Biographical/Historical

*DACS*: [2.7](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/03_chapter_02/07_administrative_biographical_history.html)
*Collection-level*: Levels 1 and 2 required, Level 3 optional
*Component-level*: Unused

**Content Guidelines**

Biographical/Historical notes are a short narrative biography of the person or history of the corporate entity that created or collected the materials being described.

This note helps the researcher place the manuscript materials or records in their proper context. The focus should be on topics most represented in the collection being described.

## Scope and Contents

*DACS*: [3.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/04_chapter_03/01_scope_and_content.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Series-level optimal, lower-level optional/generally unused

**Content Guidelines**

Scope and Contents notes describe the nature of materials for researchers to judge relevance to their needs. They may include information about the functions or activities, subject matter, persons or corporate entities, dates or time periods, and material types present.

The collection-level Scope and Contents note should describe the collection as a whole. Scope and Contents notes at lower levels, such as at the series or file level, should describe that particular aggregate in greater detail.

**Examples**

## Conditions Governing Access

*DACS*: [4.1](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/01_conditions_governing_access.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Optional

**Content Guidelines**

Conditions Governing Access note is a succinct statement regarding any access restrictions to the materials. Access restrictions should be placed on a collection if some of the material in a collection is not available to researchers. Restrictions may be imposed by the donor, the institution's policies, or the sensitive nature of the materials. The note should specify the details of the restriction, indicate the specific materials to which the restriction applies (e.g., the entire collection, a particular series, a particular box, etc.) and, if applicable, the duration of the restriction or the date on which the restriction will be lifted. Optionally, use a second, unpublished subnote to communicate restriction details internally. *If a collection contains an access restriction, be sure the "restrictions apply" box is checked under* [Basic Information](https://../02_arrangement/02_03_resources.md#basic-information)
*in the resource record.*

**Examples**

Collection is open for research.

Collection is open for research except Box 10 which is closed until 2030.

Collection is open for research, but Boxes 5 and 6 must remain with the Reading Room Archivist. Researchers may look through one folder at a time.

Collection is closed for research. Permission for access may be granted by the Reuther Director.

## Conditions Governing Use {#conditions-governing-use-1}

*DACS*: [4.4](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/04_conditions_governing_reproduction_and_use.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Optional

**Content Guidelines**

Conditions Governing Use notes detail any restrictions on reproduction or publication after access to materials has been granted due to copyright, donor agreement, or other reasons.

The Reuther has drafted several boilerplate statements to be used with collections based on processing levels and/or those that include oral histories, listed below. Use the appropriate statement and add any additional restrictions specific to that collection, if applicable. If an additional use restriction is needed, specify what portion of the collection it applies to (a specific box, the whole collection, etc.) and provide an explanation of why a use agreement will be required. Make sure the "restrictions apply" box is checked under Basic Information in the resource record.

**Boilerplate Text**

| Use | Text |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library <title render="doublequote">Rules for Use of Archival Materials</title>. |
| Levels 2 and 3 | Refer to the Walter P. Reuther Library <title render="doublequote"> Rules for Use of Archival Materials</title>. Restrictions: Researchers may encounter records of a sensitive nature — personnel files, case records and those involving investigations, legal and other private matters. Privacy laws and restrictions imposed by the Library prohibit the use of names and other personal information which might identify an individual, except with written permission from the Director and/or the donor |
| Oral Histories | RESTRICTIONS: Due to the personal nature of oral history, the Library prohibits use of the material in any way that infringes on individual right to privacy, or results in libelous statements or slander, in accordance with U.S. law. |

**Examples**

RESEARCHERS USING Box 5 MUST SIGN A RESTRICTED USE FORM. NO NAMES APPEARING IN THE FBI, MICHIGAN STATE POLICE OR DETROIT POLICE RED SQUAD FILES (Box 5, Folders 10-14), OTHER THAN THOSE OF GENORA AND SOL DOLLINGER, MAY BE CITED WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL NAMED. NO UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL IN RESTRICTED FILES MAY BE COPIED.

Researchers must sign a restricted use form to acknowledge the following 5 oral history interviews may not be published, copied, or directly quoted from without the permission of the interviewee: NAME, NAME, NAME, NAME, NAME.

RESEARCHERS USING THE [COLLECTION NAME] ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN A RESTRICTED USE STATEMENT PROTECTING CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. NO NAMES OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE CLIENTS OR THEIR RELATIVES AND ACQUAINTANCES MAY APPEAR IN RESEARCH NOTES, WRITTEN OR ORAL PRESENTATIONS OR BE CITED FOR PUBLICATION.REPRODUCTION (PHOTOCOPY OR PHOTOGRAPHY) OF DOCUMENTS IN THIS COLLECTION IS PROHIBITED.

RESEARCHERS MUST SIGN A RESTRICTED USE STATEMENT AND AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS OUTLINED IN THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA). NO NAMES OR OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION FOUND IN THE RECORDS MAY BE USED, QUOTED, OR CITED.

## Physical Location

*DACS*: [4.2.6](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/05_chapter_04/02_physical_access.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Unused

!!! note Our current use of Physical Location notes differs from their intended use and will eventually be replaced with ArchivesSpace Top Container/Location management functionality

**Content Guidelines**

Physical Location notes provide information about the location of the materials being described if that location affects access to those materials.

The Reuther currently uses collection-level Physical Location notes to record the stacks location(s) of the materials. Ensure that the collection-level Physical Location note is **unpublished**. Stacks location should be formatted: [stacks area]-[shelf letter]-[shelf column]{leave no space between column and shelf range}[shelf #s]. Example: 4W-L-8(5-6)

Since a single collection may be housed throughout the building, specify the location of individual boxes/items following this format (include only applicable information):

Part #: physloc [boxes #-#], physloc [boxes #-#, #]; Part #: physloc [box #], physloc [volumes #-#]. Example: Part 1: 3S-B-2(1)[Boxes 1-6), 3S-C-2(2)[Boxes 7-12]; Part 2: 4W-W-2(1-4)[Boxes 13-34]

## Immediate Source of Acquisition

*DACS*: [5.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/06_chapter_05/02_immediate_source_of_acquisition.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Unused

**Content Guidelines**

An Immediate Source of Acquisition note indicates the person or corporate body from which the Reuther received the collection and the date it was received.

**Boilerplate Language**

The [collection title] were/was donated to the Walter P. Reuther
Library in/on [date] by [donor].

## Processing Information

*DACS*: [7.1.8](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/08_chapter_07/01_notes.html#processing-information)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Unused

**Content Guidelines**

The Processing Information note contains information about the archivist's actions during processing or about conventions in the finding aid that might impact a researcher's interpretation of the records or understanding of information provided in the finding aid. Possible actions described include devising of component titles or modifications to previously published description, container numbers, accession numbers, etc. Modifications to a collection should also be noted under Revision Statements.

At a minimum, the Reuther uses the below boilerplate language to identify the name of the processing archivist if known and the time period in which the collection was processed.

**Boilerplate Language**

Processed and finding aid written by [Walter P. Reuther Library] on [Month Day, Year].

**Examples**

Processed and finding aid written by Walter P. Reuther Library in 1986 and new material processed and finding aid updated by [Archivist Name] on May 22, 2025.

## Arrangement {#arrangement-1}

*DACS*: [3.2](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/04_chapter_03/02_system_of_arrangement.html)
*Resource-level*: Required
*Component-level*: Unused

**Content Guidelines**

The Arrangement note describes the current organization of the collection. It should describe the hierarchy of the collection including the number of parts, series, and subseries and their names, if applicable. The note may also describe the arrangement of the collection as a whole or within a given aggregation, such as if the material is organized alphabetically, chronologically, in original order, etc.

The Reuther uses several boilerplate statements for Arrangement notes that correspond to the processing level. Refer to the statements below and make any modifications as necessary.

If material is a single oral history transcript, the Arrangement note should read: "Transcript arranged alphabetically by surname with other individual oral history transcripts at the Walter P. Reuther Library."

**Boilerplate Language**

| Level | Text |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Arranged in [##] series -- Series 1 (Box [#]), Series 2 (Box [##-##]) and Series 3 (Box [##-##]). Folders are arranged alphabetically, chronologically, in original order, etc. Additional arrangement description, if needed. |
| Level 2 | The collection is arranged into [#] series. Folders in each series are simply listed by their location within each box. They are not arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout several boxes within each series. Series 1: Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#) Series 2: Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#) Series 3: Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#) Series [#]: Title, YYYY-YYYY (Box #-#) |
| Level 3 | Folders are listed by their location within each box. They are not necessarily arranged, so any given subject may be dispersed throughout the entire collection. |
