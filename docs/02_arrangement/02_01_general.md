# Arrangement and Description: General

## Opening Unprocessed Accessions

Post-accessioning, if collections cannot be immediately processed at one
of the three [processing levels](#processing-levels), they may instead
be minimally described at the collection level, opened, and added to the
processing queue. This involves the following:

1.  **Reuther Building Coordinator** assigns stacks location.

2.  **Archivist** creates an ArchivesSpace using collection-level
    description (copy and paste any relevant info from ArchivesSpace )

-   !!! note - *If the collection is an addition or accrual*, the
    existing ArchivesSpace resource record will be edited instead.
    ArchivesSpace will amalgamate a new inventory onto the end of the
    current inventory list. Restricted accruals may be published at the
    discretion of the collection archivist.

3.  If an inventory exists in electronic format, it can be copied and
    pasted into the [ArchivesSpace Bulk Import
    Template](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/ASpace_bulk_import_template.xlsx?d=w90e4f1e292594c3da05912268ca05019&csf=1&web=1&e=VObW9h),
    imported into ArchivesSpace as a resource record, and merged.
    (Contact a staff member if you do not have access to the template).

4.  If no inventory exists, the archivist determines whether the
    collection warrants series descriptions and/or box inventory and
    adds these to the ArchivesSpace resource record. List individual
    boxes separately.

5.  For analog-only / hybrid collections: **Collection Archivist**
    prepares box labels and labels boxes. See for AV transfer
    instructions.

6.  For born-digital materials: The **Digital Curation and Preservation
    Archivist** is responsible for stabilizing and normalizing
    electronic files. In coordination with Field/Collection Archivists,
    the Digital Curation and Preservation Archivist also creates an
    Archival Information Package (AIP) for long-term preservation and a
    Dissemination Information Package (DIP) for access, if necessary.

<!-- -->

2.  **Collection Archivist** makes notes regarding actions (discards,
    transfers, etc.) in the ArchivesSpace and specifies if the
    collection (or parts thereof) needs processing, to what level it
    should be processed, and what priority status should be assigned.
    Assuming further processing is needed, a [Processing
    Queue](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processing-queue) event is created to indicate the
    collection is part of the processing queue rather than fully
    processed and completed.
3.  If no further processing is needed, create a
    [Processed](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processed) event.

## Processing Levels

*Collections or individual series, are processed according to one of
three levels:*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level                               Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Level I                             folder inventory; full arrangement
                                      & description

  Level II                            box or folder inventory; series
                                      level arrangement & minimal
                                      description

  Level III                           box or folder inventory; collection
                                      level arrangement & minimal
                                      description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

On average, it takes 1-2 hours per box to open a Level II or III
collection and 4 hours per box for a Level I collection.

Regardless of level, processing should generally follow the steps
outlined in the sections below.

## Preliminaries

1.  Consult the Stacks & Case Files located in 3N/3S for provenance and
    supplementary information about a collection (if you remove a
    folder, fill out an OUT card).
    1.  Check for any donor restrictions on access and/or use of the
        collection.
    2.  Check the donor agreement (if one exists) or correspondence to
        determine how to dispose of duplicates, non-historical
        materials, and non-manuscript materials (e.g., library).
    3.  Note any inventories.
    4.  Note any pertinent information that can be used in the finding
        aid (e.g., accession date, biographical information, etc.).
    5.  If there is no deed/deposit agreement and no correspondence with
        the donor:
        1.  If possible, an agreement should always be obtained. Consult
            with the Field Archivist (or relevant Collections
            Archivist).
        2.  Check the contents of the collection for potential areas of
            concern, e.g., copyright (could anyone have a vested
            interest in maintaining copyright of photographs, etc.?),
            personal/private content (could a family or organization be
            upset about the material being available?), legal (are there
            any legal issues to opening the collection?).
        3.  Consider the collection's size - what resources will be
            required to process and keep? Are we willing to invest that
            in a collection that may not have a permanent future at the
            Reuther?
        4.  If the assessed risk is low, then the collection may be
            processed as is. If the risk is high, make an effort to
            obtain an agreement before processing or return the
            collection.
2.  Consult ArchivesSpace for additional information (accession record,
    agent(s), etc.) and updated records:
    1.  Revise (or create) an ArchivesSpace resource record, and begin recording
        information in the fields, including the [Collection
        Management](02_03_resources.md#collection-management) subrecord (Processing
        Priority, Processing Plan, Processor, and Processing hrs/unit
        Estimate). Note that not all fields can be filled out until
        processing is completed, and some will change (e.g, dates,
        extent). **Leave unpublished.**
    2.  Update the events associated with the Accession Record(s):
        1.  In the Accession Record, select Events from the side
            navigation and select Edit.
        2.  In the event's edit screen, change event type from
            [Processing New](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processing-new) to [Processing In
            Progress](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processing-in-progress).
        3.  If there are multiple accessions being processed:
            1.  Link all Accessions to this single Processing In
                Progress event record.
            2.  Delete the individual Processing New event records
                linked to each Related Accession.[^1]

<!-- -->

3.  Read pertinent literature for information about the donor, creator
    or subject of the collection. Keep notes for use in the resource
    record's History note. Continue to keep notes as you go through the
    collection for use in the finding aid.
4.  After obtaining location information, pull desired boxes from the
    stacks area. Enlist a page, if available. Inform the Reuther
    Coordinator of the number of boxes (and types) you pulled from each
    shelf locations so the Physical Location spreadsheet can be updated.
5.  Review the collection.
    1.  Examine existing inventories to determine original file order if
        applicable.
    2.  Examine, briefly, the collection as a whole. Become acquainted
        with the present arrangement, scope of the collection, years
        covered, possible subjects, and types and sizes of materials.
6.  Determine arrangement plan.
    1.  Review any previously processed parts of the collection or
        similar collections (e.g. other union offices, if processing
        union records) to assist in determining arrangement.
    2.  When deciding what level to process the collection or addition,
        keep in mind extent, research value and donor relations (e.g.,
        the terms and conditions in the donor agreement).
    3.  **For Level I or Level II**: If there is no existing discernible
        order that can easily be maintained:
        1.  Establish series (if needed) by subject matter, creating
            office, document type, or time period depending on what most
            logically reflects the history of the creator or is most
            useful to the researcher.
        2.  Remember that not all portions of a collection must be
            processed to the same level of detail. Make determinations
            series-by-series.
        3.  Consider using broadly-defined series and avoiding
            subseries, especially for collections that are likely to
            receive additions or accruals.
    4.  **For Level III**: Keep materials in their received order and do
        not arrange.
7.  Determine if any materials need to be deaccessioned at this stage,
    such as materials that duplicate holdings, fall outside established
    collecting scopes, are non-historical, subject to donor agreements
    and legal restrictions. \[**Note: Deaccessioning Events are
    necessary only for whole accessions or significant portions of an
    accession and do not apply to discards from processing.**\]
    1.  Follow the prescribed actions set forth in the donor agreement.
    2.  If there is no donor agreement, adhere to deaccessioning section
        of the *Collection Policy*[^2]. Actions include returning
        materials to the donor, transferring materials to another
        repository, and destruction.
        1.  Materials that pose a potential threat to staff and
            researchers should be transferred to Wayne State
            University's Department of Public Safety or Office of Risk
            Management.
        2.  For non-historical materials that may have monetary value,
            where you cannot establish contact with the donor, materials
            may be donated or transferred to another institution. If you
            are unclear discuss with the director and/or the Collections
            Committee.
    3.  Document the deaccession: Create and link a [Deaccession
        Event](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#deaccession) to the accession record. Add a
        "Deaccession" note to the accession record explaining how, why,
        and when the material was deaccessioned, as well as if it was
        returned to the donor or otherwise disposed. \[This only applies
        to deaccessioning a whole accession or significant portion of an
        accession; instructions for handling material discarded during
        processing can be found under [Processing
        Completion](#completion).\]
    4.  Remove the box(es) from your processing area
        1.  Make arrangements with donor for pick up or mailing
        2.  Recycling/trash: dispose of in dumpster or leave by the
            receiving door
        3.  Shredding: transfer to Room 19 and notify Reuther Building
            Coordinator
        4.  Hazardous materials: notify Reuther Building Coordinator and
            contact Public Safety/Office of Risk Management

## Processing

The following guidelines give a comprehensive approach. Depending to
what level a collection is being processed, not all of the
recommendations are applicable. For Level II & III processing, item
level investigation is discouraged and thus many of these steps are
unnecessary.

### General Rules

1.  Do not arrange material within the folders.

2.  Avoid reading through the collection more than one time.

3.  If a document requires identification with notations regarding date,
    place, or author, those notations should be penciled in lightly in
    the upper right-hand corner in brackets to indicate that the
    archivist made the notation.

### Arrange the Collections

1.  For **Level I or II**: If applicable and not already determined by
    creator, separate the collection into 2 or more series. *Do not
    create a collection with only 1 series*.
    1.  For **Level I**, impose (or leave existing) system of
        arrangement.
    2.  For **Level II**, leave each series as it stands, physically
        arranging only to consolidate folders within a single box.
    3.  For **Level III**: simply leave the collection as it stands,
        physically arranging only to consolidate folders within a single
        box.

#### Discards

Though item-level review is discouraged, the items listed below should
be removed from the collection when encountered. Keep notes on
accumulated discards while processing and follow [Processing
Completion](#completion) steps to document and manage their disposition.

-   Blank paper
-   Duplicate copies (retain originals and any duplicates with
    handwritten notes or different formats)
-   Nonhistorical items such as grocery lists, minor receipts, etc.
-   Housekeeping items such as bills and cancelled checks
-   Brochures for travel, equipment, etc.
-   Routine forms, such as those for travel expenses
-   Papers with only doodles, phone numbers with no names, etc.
-   Empty folders with no unique information (or set aside those
    suitable for reuse)
-   Envelopes, unless they contain important information
-   Magazines unrelated to the subject content of the collection (tear
    out any relevant article and retain)
-   Government documents, unless removing them would destroy the
    integrity of the file/collection
-   Illegible materials

#### Preservation

1.  If necessary to preserve the integrity of the document, remove
    *rusted* metal fasteners and replace with vinyl paper clips.

2.  Discard rubber bands.

3.  Remove binders and report covers, old envelopes and other
    unnecessary items. If they contain titles or information not
    included in the letter or report, trim and retain that portion.

4.  Place acid-free bond paper between deteriorating items (e.g.,
    newsprint).

5.  In the resource record's Collection Management \> Processing Plan \>
    Conservation Description/Location section, note the box location and
    type of items needing further action, such as deteriorating paper
    (e.g., newsprint, carbon paper, or Thermofax at risk of becoming
    illegible) as well as items that are torn, soiled, or need
    flattening.

6.  For items with water and/or mold damage[^3], do the following:

    1.  For small amounts of wet materials, air-dry. For extensive
        amounts, contact an environmental company to freeze for mold
        growth prevention.
    2.  Documents bound together via water damage should not be
        physically separated. If separating is deemed necessary given
        the material's historical value, find a conservator.
    3.  Material with mold:
        1.  Wear protective clothing (gloves, respirators/masks,
            goggles, disposable aprons or smocks, etc.)
        2.  Isolate the moldy material from the rest of the collection.
        3.  Determine if the mold is active.
            1.  If active mold is present, contact Reuther Building
                Coordinator and FP&M to evaluate the physical
                environment where the material was stored. Dispose of
                the material and record in the Resource Record
                deaccession note; or, if the material is of substantial
                historical value, contact a conservator for remediation.
            2.  For inactive mold, do one of the following:
                1.  Dispose of the material and record in the resource
                    record.
                2.  For material of substantial historical value,
                    contact a conservator to clean.

#### Physical Foldering

1.  Do not arrange material within the folders.

2.  Divide the contents of folders thicker than one inch. Try to make
    logical divisions, e.g. dividing by months or years or by chapters.

3.  Replace folders that are in poor condition with new or good-quality
    used ones of a size appropriate for the collection (i.e., letter or
    legal size).

4.  Organize and folder loose material by subject, format,
    correspondent, or another logical grouping.

5.  Remove hanging folders and if necessary, folder their contents.

6.  Remove and folder material from 3-ring binders, report covers, and
    envelopes.

> Bound items that can fit into a storage box can remain unfoldered.

#### Folder Headings

As the description of the materials in each folder of the collection is
an important access point for the researcher, it is important that the
folder headings be as accurate, consistent, complete, and concise as
possible. DACS standards applied in the creation of collection-level
description also apply to folder headings when devised by the archivist.
Note that it is acceptable to use full description in the ArchivesSpace
inventory and abbreviate on the physical folders.

These headings should be written legibly in pencil on the folder tabs.

1.  Write legibly in pencil on folder tabs

2.  Leave a space on the left for folder numbers. *Do not add numbers
    until processing is complete*.

3.  Use existing headings if they accurately describe folder contents

4.  If needed, compose new, DACS-compliant headings

5.  The type of material (correspondence, minutes, etc.) and dates
    should be indicated where appropriate

##### Terminology and Abbreviations

1.  Select words that describe exactly what is in each folder. Use
    Library of Congress Subject Headings wherever possible. Do not use
    unhelpful words like "miscellaneous" and "etc."

2.  Common abbreviations for organizations like the UAW, AFL-CIO, etc.
    can be used. However, abbreviations should be written in full in the
    first instance with the abbreviation in parentheses (i.e. "Full
    Title (ACRONYM)").

3.  Do not abbreviate the names of people

4.  Abbreviate states using United State Postal Service codes, such as
    MI

##### Dates

Each folder heading should indicate the dates of materials in the folder
if possible (Level II & III collections may be the exceptions).

1.  Write single dates as follows without punctuation: YYYY Month DD
    (e.g., 1945 April 25). Expression of dates should not be given in
    all numerals.

2.  Standard abbreviation can be used for months but spell out the full
    word in the ArchivesSpace record

3.  Indicate inclusive dates as follows: YYYY-YYYY (e.g. 1935-1939)

4.  If there is a significant gap in chronological sequence of the
    documents in a folder, use commas to separate the dates or date
    ranges: 1999, 2005-2010

5.  If bulk dates are needed to clarify folder contents use ", bulk
    YYYY-YYYY" after the inclusive dates. Do not use parentheses.

6.  If the document is not dated, but you have been able to determine
    its age, use one of the following statements preceding the estimated
    date:

    -   circa
    -   after
    -   before

7.  If no date can be determined, write "undated."

##### Punctuation and Format

1.  Use commas before the date or when appropriate to separate words,
    for example: "Carey, James, Secretary-Treasurer, 1955-1968"

2.  Spell out words rather than using symbols (e.g. write "and" versus
    "&").

3.  Do not use a period at the end of folder headings.

4.  Do not capitalize letters except the first word, acronyms, proper
    nouns, or titles (i.e., use sentence case)

5.  For files larger than 1 inch that are divided into multiple folders,
    include total number of files in parentheses, after the date, e.g.
    (1 of 2), (2 of 2), etc.

#### Boxing

1.  Rebox the collection in new Paige storage boxes, if necessary.
    Hollinger manuscript boxes may be used for high-value collections or
    if the collection is too small for a storage box.

2.  If reusing old boxes, make sure all old labels are crossed out and
    the folders are facing the new front end of the box.

3.  Put enough folders in a box so they fit snugly and support each
    other but can still be removed with ease. Do not leave room in a box
    because it is the end of a series. Begin the next series in the same
    box. Use blue "e-flute" spacers to fill any extra space in your last
    box.

4.  Contact the Reuther Building Coordinator for the physical location
    for the number and type of boxes in the collection.

5.  As the last step in processing, apply box-folder numbers to folders.

    1.  Number folders consecutively within each box. Do not restart
        numbering for each series.

    2.  On the upper left corner of the folder tab, write box number,
        hyphen, folder number (e.g., 1-1 for box 1, folder 1, or 5-8 for
        box 5, folder 8).

    3.  If using an existing heading and there is no room on the tab,
        write the numbers just below.

    4.  For bound items kept inside boxes, assign numbers as you would
        folders. If possible, lightly pencil the number on the front or
        inside cover of the item.

6.  Label the front end of each box using the appropriate [label
    template(s)](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/Labels?csf=1&web=1&e=NZSdsf)
    (contact staff member if you cannot access the template).

    1.  Labels should include accession number, box number (optional:
        append "of \[total box#\]" if collection is unlikely to have
        accrual or addition), collection title, and location.

    2.  If you are processing an addition to an existing collection,
        your numbering will begin not with Box 1, but where the original
        collection left off.

    3.  Do not reformat the labels (unless you need to adjust font size
        in the title only) or add any other information.

    4.  Use additional color-coded labels for boxes containing AV,
        fragile, closed and/or restricted materials (restrictions are:
        box must remain at reference desk, box must be used at table
        directly in front of reference desk), or materials that should
        not be duplicated (contact AV department for fragile labels).

    5.  Affix labels to boxes using pH neutral glue to prevent the
        labels from falling off over time

## Description Workflow

When a collection has been processed (i.e. arranged), the next step is
to create a finding aid (i.e., description) so it can be made
accessible. To do this, complete the following steps:

1.  Create a DACS-compliant description and enter it into the
    collection's ArchivesSpace , using the appropriate template text
    based on the processing level (I, II, or III).

2.  [Create and inventory](02_04_archival_objects) (box/folder list) using one of the detailed methods

3.  If the collection has any restrictions that require all or a portion
    of it to be closed, add a [Temporarily
    Closed](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#temporarily-closed) event. If the collection was only
    partially processed, add a [Processing
    Partial](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processing-partial) event.

4.  In the related accession record(s), update the Processing in
    Progress event to [Processed](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#processed).

5.  Complete the Collection Checklist, and place it in the digital case
    file \[HOLD02 \> CaseFiles\> (select appropriate files)\], and hard
    copy case file, if applicable.

## Finding Aid/Resource Record

1.  Complete collection description based on the Level I, Level II or
    Level III procedures and template text provided in the
    ArchivesSpace: Resource Record.

2.  Describe your arrangement scheme and create the .

3.  Consult notes taken during the [preliminaries](#preliminaries) and
    processing, as well as your inventory, to complete the front matter
    of the finding aid (e.g. title through scope & content).

4.  For **Level I**, complete a full History and Scope & Content note.
    For **Levels II & III**, provide minimal necessary information in
    history / biographical note.

5.  Edit and revise any previous drafts.

## Completion

1.  Complete the ArchivesSpace Resource Record [Collection Management
    Subrecord](02_03_resources.md#collection-management) (Processing Total Extent,
    Extent Type, Total Processing Hours, Funding Source).

2.  Discarding sensitive and other materials (duplicates, blank pieces
    of paper, nonhistorical, etc.):

    1.  Shred sensitive materials:
        1.  Write "SHRED," the date, and your initials on the box(es)
            containing material needing to be shredded. Tape box lids
            shut.
        2.  Move the boxes to Room 19.
        3.  Inform the Reuther Building Coordinator of the number of
            boxes added to Room 19.
    2.  Boxes that do not need shredding go in the dumpster or
        Receiving.
    3.  Document the discards/shredded materials: Fill out the Resource
        Record \> Collection Management \> Processing Plan field \>
        Discard section and indicate the type and amount of material
        discarded/shredded.

3.  Arrange for transfer of any AV or vault materials.

4.  Record locations of all material (regardless of physical location in
    separate departments, e.g., AV and digital materials) in the
    ArchivesSpace resource record location note.

5.  Ensure the Resource Record is "published"
