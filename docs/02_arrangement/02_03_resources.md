    3. Repeat above steps for any additional related accessions.

## Agent Links
Add [agent links](../03_shared/03_03_agents_subjects.md#agents) for the creator(s) as well as any person, corporate, and family subjects that need to be access points to the collection

## Subject Links
Add [subject links](../03_shared/03_03_agents_subjects.md#subjects) to important subjects that need to be access points to the collection. 

## Notes
To edit a note, select expand and modify the content. If a note does not apply, or there is no applicable content, delete it: select the X in the upper right of the note box, and then select “confirm removal.” To add a note, select “Add Note” on the “Notes” Subrecord title bar. In the new note field, select the Note Type from the dropdown (one of the numbered notes below). Check the Publish checkbox (unless the note should be for staff only, e.g., location). Add the note in the Content box (and check the publish checkbox if there is one).

If the collection has multiple parts, with differing note content in each part, add a sub note for each part when necessary. (For example, if a finding aid has two parts each with its own Scope and Contents note, create a Scope and Contents note for part one, and a sub note within the Scope and Contents note for part two. If the Preferred Citation is the same for both parts, only create one Preferred Citation note.)

The following notes are either required for all Resources or required if applicable. Do not add any notes that are not listed below. Refer to the linked entry in the [shared note documentation](../03_shared/03_04_notes.md) for content guidelines and examples for each note.
