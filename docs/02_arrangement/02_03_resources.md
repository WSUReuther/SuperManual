# Resources/Collection-level Description

An ArchivesSpace **Resource record** is used to create a finding aid and
record information about a collection.

In ArchivesSpace select: *Create > Resource Record*. A resource record  with default field values will appear. Fill in and edit the fields as  indicated below. The record will contain more fields than those listed  below, but **do NOT enter/change any information in a field that is not  indicated below**.

!!! note "If there are not default field values, i.e. you do not see a DACS  compliant collection title in the Title field, then select Repository Preferences from the drop-down menu next to your ID in the upper right corner of ASpace. Select the box next to 'Pre-populate records?' and click "save". Then repeat the steps to create a resource record."

Edit the information in square brackets (`[ ]`) and delete the brackets. Choose the proper selection from those listed in *italics*."

The instructions below can be used both for creating and editing resource records.

2. **Identifier**: [Accession #]

5. **Restrictions Apply?**: Check box if restrictions apply. If there are no restrictions, leave unchecked. Additional description of the restrictions will be entered in the Access and Use restriction notes.
6. **Repository Processing Notes**: Describe any missing material {"[Box #, Folder #] is missing as of [YYYY-MM-DD] -- [Your name]"}, or any anomaly / oddity about the processing of the collection (e.g., multiple collections processed into one). Otherwise, leave it blank.

## Languages

1. **Language**: Select the language of materials. If more than one language is present, click "Add Language" button and add the appropriate information.

1.  **Select**: Add Revision Statement
2.  **Revision Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD revision made]
3.  **Revision Description**: [Describe changes made to resource record and by whom.]
4.  **Publish?**: Select "publish" if this note should be viewable to the public or will help researchers understand a change to the record. Leave it unselected if this revision is meant for internal use only.

## Related Accessions

1.  **Select**: *Add Related Accession*
2.  Type in the collection name or accession number. Alternatively, select Browse from the drop-down menu.
3.  Select the accession processed to create the resource record. Do NOT link unprocessed accessions (related unprocessed accessions should be linked to other accessions, NOT resources).
4.  Repeat above steps for any additional related accessions.

## Agent Links

Add [agent links](../03_shared/03_03_agents_subjects.md) for the creator(s) as well as any person, corporate, and family subjects that need to be access points to the collection.

## Subject Links

Add [subject links](../03_shared/03_03_agents_subjects.md#subjects) to important subjects that need to be access points to the collection.

## Notes

To edit a note, select expand and modify the content. If a note does not  apply, or there is no applicable content, delete it: select the X in the  upper right of the note box, and then select "confirm removal." To add a  note, select "Add Note" in the "Notes" Subrecord title bar. In the new  note field, select the Note Type from the dropdown (one of the numbered  notes below). Check the Publish checkbox (unless the note should be for  staff only, e.g., location). Add the note in the Content box (and check  the publish checkbox if there is one).

If the collection has multiple parts, with differing note content in  each part, add a sub note for each part when necessary. (For example, if  a finding aid has two parts each with its own Scope and Contents note,  create a Scope and Contents note for part one, and a sub note within the  Scope and Contents note for part two.) Note that creating Parts is no  longer encouraged.

The following notes are either required for all Resources or required if  applicable. Do not add any notes that are not listed below. Refer to the  linked entry in the [shared note documentation](../03_shared/03_04_notes.md) for content guidelines and  examples for each note.
