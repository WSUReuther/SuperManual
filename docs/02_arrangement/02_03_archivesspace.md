## Inventories for ArchivesSpace
To most efficiently enter inventories for newly processed collections into ArchivesSpace, begin by typing the Box:folder list into the [Excel inventory template](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/FA_Inventories.xlsx), separate from the collection level description already entered directly into ArchivesSpace. After completing the inventory in Excel, hidden columns are unhidden and the entire sheet is copied and pasted into the [EAD inventory template](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/FA_EADtemplate_InventoryOnly.xml). Mandatory tags in the EAD are completed, the EAD inventory only file is saved, and then imported into ArchivesSpace, creating an inventory only resource record. The inventory only resource record is merged into the description resource record, creating a complete resource record containing the collection’s description and inventory.

This process can be used for first time inventories as well as adding an inventory for an accrual or addition. An inventory-only resource record that is merged into a resource record with an existing inventory, is added to the end of the current existing inventory. Therefore, any subsequent inventory is simply added to the end of the current box-folder list.

These instructions are specific to the EAD – All levels Template, but the same principals can be applied to any of the templates in the [Excel inventory template](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/FA_Inventories.xlsx).

### Create Inventory in Excel
1.	**Open the** [Excel inventory template](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/FA_Inventories.xlsx) and save it as [Accession#]_Inv.xlsx.
2.	**Select the Sheet that best fits your arrangement**: EAD – All levels (part, series, subseries, file), Series + Sub (series, subseries, file), Series (series and file only), File Only (collection level arrangement- a box/folder list).
3.	**Add and/or remove Parts, Series, and Subseries headings** (ensuring that titles are included for any series and subseries), in column B to reflect the collection inventory. Delete **any example headings** if they do not apply to your collection. Note that if this is an additional part, the series numbering continues from the previous part.
4.	**For each Box**:
    1. **Insert the required number of rows** within the appropriate Series (alternatively Subseries or Parts), to reflect the number of folders in a box. 

    !!! note
        If your folder numbering in a legacy Word guide has number range bullets (e.g. 5-10.  Correspondence), you will only need to add one row in Excel.

    2. **Input the Box number** in the first row beneath the heading, in column G (D in File Only).  Move your cursor over the bottom right corner of that cell until you see a black plus sign. Click and drag down through all the rows for that box to copy the box number to all the rows. For any instances of a box title only being listed (rather than folders/items in the box), delete the `<container type=”Folder”>` following `</container>` tags (rows I – K, except in the File Only template, rows F – H)
    3. **Input the folder numbers**. 
        1. In column J (G in File Only), insert the number “1” for the first folder in the box (see example in the template).
        2. Move your cursor over the bottom right corner of the cell until you see a black plus sign. Click and drag down through all the rows for that box. If this populates all those cells with the number “1”, click on the pop-up button  and choose the bullet next to *Fill Series*. This will auto-populate your folder numbers.
        3. If materials in the box are not stored in folders, (i.e., scrapbooks, tapes, realia), change container type from “Folder” to “Item,” (e.g., `<container type=”Item”>`).
    4. **Input the folder titles**.

        !!! note
            Do NOT use special characters or ampersands (i.e., &) as they will not import correctly into ASpace. 

        1. **For new box:folder lists**, simply type in the folder titles in column M (J in File Only), next to the corresponding folder number.
	
    5. **Copy EAD tags in Excel**.
        1. Select all cells and choose *Column>Unhide* from the *Format* menu. The EAD tagging structure will now be visible under Box 1, in the same row as Folder 1.
        2. Ensure the numbering of all your `<c>` level tags are correct:
            - If you have parts:
              - `<c01>` = Part, `<c02>` = Series, `<c03>` = Subseries, `<c04>` = File
              - OR
              - `<c01> `= Part, `<c02>` = Series, `<c03>` = File
              - OR
              - `<c01>` = Part, `<c02> `= File
            - If you have Series:  
                - `<c01>` = Series, `<c02>` = Subseries, `<c03>` = File
                - OR
                - `<c01>` Series, `<c02>` = File
            - If you have no Series:
                - `<c01>` = File

        !!! note
            Note that these may vary throughout the document, (e.g., if Series 1 has subseries, file =`<c04>`, and if Series 2 does not have subseries, file =`<c03>`).
            Update all `<c>` tags for levels Parts, Series, and Subseries (all that are applicable) found in column A and File level tags found in columns D and P (columns A and M in File Only).

        3. **Autofill the EAD tags** in Column D (A in File Only), using the same method listed above (see II.D. 2), by clicking and dragging down through ALL the lines of your spreadsheet stopping with the last line (i.e. don’t autofill blank lines past your last folder title). 
        4. Repeat the same autofill process for remaining EAD tags in Columns E, F, H, I, K, L, N, O, and P (B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, and M in File Only). If you have any unused columns, delete them.

### Turn Text Inventory into EAD
1.	Open the [EAD Inventory file](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/FA_EADtemplate_InventoryOnly.xml) and paste in the inventory using TextEdit or Oxygen. 
    - Rename the EAD Inventory file as [Accession#]_Inv.xml.
    - Delete row 1 in your Excel document (this is the row with your column headers, i.e., “Box #,” “Box Title,” etc.) Then select all the cells in the Excel document and copy them.
    - **In your EAD file ([Accession#]_INV.xml)**, insert your cursor after `<dsc type=“combined”>`.
    - Paste contents and use the indent button to format. 
    - If you’re using TextEdit, click “OK” when asked to change the file type to Unicode-8.
2.	Fill in the content of mandatory tags at the beginning of the XML file.
    1. `<eadheader>`
        1. `<eadid>`
            - Supply the accession number with “_INV” appended at the end.
    2. `<archdesc>`
        1. `<did>`
            1. `<unittitle>`
                - Supply the DACs title of the collection with “Inventory” appended at the end.
            2. `<unitdate type=”inclusive”>`
                - Complete the normal attribute inside the tag by typing dates as YYYY/YYYY
                - Supply the inclusive dates as YYYY-YYYY
            3. `<physdesc><extent>`
                - Complete element with standardized extent statement
                - Example: `<physdesc><extent> 10 linear feet (8 SB, 2 OS) </extent></physdesc>`
            4. `<unitid>`
                - Supply the accession number, appending “_INV” on the end to distinguish it from the actual accession record.

### Import EAD Inventory into ArchivesSpace
1.	**Import EAD into ArchivesSpace**
    1. Select “Create > Background Jobs”
    2. On the Background Jobs page, select “Import Data” in the Jobs Type drop down.
    3. On the New Background Job page select “EAD” in the “import Type” dropdown and select the “+ Add file” button.
    4. Select your inventory EAD file.
    5. Select “Queue Job.”
    6. After completion, select “Refresh Job.”

2.	**Merge Inventory Resource Record into the Description Resource Record**
    1. Open the original ASpace resource record that you entered your collection description in.
    2. Select “Merge” from the row of buttons above the collection title and enter the name of the corresponding inventory’s resource record (e.g. Resource Record Inventory).
    3. Select “Merge”
    4. The descriptive resource record now contains the inventory.
    5. Select “Save”
    6. Update the record to include any additional information, e.g., series scope and content notes.

## Editing Inventories for ArchivesSpace
An inventory may need to be edited because an additional part has been processed, an error needs to be corrected, an additional item needs to be moved or added. Most of these issues can be handled directly within ArchivesSpace.

### Add Inventory
In the case where an additional part was processed, create an inventory as described in [Create Inventory in Excel](#create-inventory-in-excel), import, and merge it into the previously created resource record. ArchivesSpace appends additional inventories directly after the existing inventory. For all other use cases, see below.

### Edit Individual Component
ArchivesSpace refers to items in an inventory as “components.” To edit a component directly, click on it in the inventory tree. This will open up the component record and it may be edited similarly to a resource record.

### Reorder Components

## ArchivesSpace: Events
In ASpace, Event records document actions that an archivist has taken upon a record (e.g., processing, deaccessioning, digitizing), as well as linking records together (e.g., in a “Processed” event, the accession and resource records are linked).

Events in ASpace can be created two ways:
1.	Use the Create menu. Select: Create > Event Record. An empty event record will appear. Fill in and edit the fields as indicated below.
2.	Create an event from within an accession or resource record.
    1.	Select: Add Event dropdown
    2.	Choose the event type (Processing New, Processing In Progress, Processed, Processing Queue, Processing Partial, Temporarily Closed, or Deaccession)
    3.	Select: Add Event. An empty event record will appear. Fill in and edit the fields as indicated below.

Event records in ASpace can be edited (including the type, i.e., changing an event from “Processing New” to “Processing In Progress”) in two ways:

1.	Search/Browse for the event record. In search/browse results. Select: Edit next to the event you wish to edit. The event will open in edit mode.  
2.	Directly within the linked accession or resource record.
    1.	In view mode, scroll down to the Events Subrecord.
    2.	Select: Edit next to the event you wish to edit. The event will open in edit mode.

The record will contain more fields than those listed below, but **do NOT enter/change any information in a field that is not indicated below.**

Edit the information in [ ]s (and delete the brackets). Choose the proper selection from those listed in italics. Note that the result for all “Outcome” fields is “Pass” because the event is created upon completion of the successful action taken by the archivist.

The instructions below can be used both for creating and editing event records. 

Note that for Processing New, Processing In Progress, and Processed, often the event can simply be edited to a different event type rather than creating a brand new event.

The following table shows the possible combination of events in any single ArchivesSpace record (indicated with an X):

| Event: | 	Processing Partial | Temporarily Closed | Deaccession |	Digitization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Processing New | | | x | |
| Processing In Progress | | | x | |	
| Processed | x | x | x | x |
| Processing Queue | | | x | |

### Processing in Progress
A Processing In Progress event replaces the Processing New event for an accession that is undergoing processing. If multiple accessions are undergoing processing at the same time to create a single resource record (i.e., the processed collection is made up of several accessions), change one Processing New event to a Processing in Progress event, link all of the accessions to it, and delete the remaining Processing New events.

### Processing Partial
A Processing Partial event indicates that only a portion of the accession is processed. This event can be used in conjunction with the Processed event (this does not preclude the accession from being linked to a resource record that has been processed).
