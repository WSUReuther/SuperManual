# Arrangement and Description: Special Formats

## Audiovisual

The following guidelines apply to audiovisual (AV) material found within
manuscript and records collection accessions (exceptions may include
donor institution collections, or highly valuable materials).

!!! note Collections predominantly containing AV materials are processed in the AV department according to separate guidelines.

AV material is defined as the following:

-   Photographic prints, negatives, and slides
-   Audio recordings (phonographic records, magnetic tape, digital tape)
-   Motion picture film
-   Video recordings (magnetic tape, digital tape)
-   Graphic art (posters, drawings, prints, architectural plans, signs,
    banners, textiles)
-   Fine art (paintings, sculpture)

### Arrangement

!!! note For additions to collections, check with the Audiovisual Department (AV) **before** foldering or boxing to see whether legacy material is already being housed separately.

Determination must be made whether to shelve AV material boxes alongside the manuscript or records boxes or transfer them to the Audiovisual Department (AV) for storage and access. In general, formats that require special equipment for viewing are kept in the AV Department.
**Use the following format-specific guidelines to make your determination**:

-   **Photographic prints** or any other positive image paper-based materials (i.e., graphic art) are shelved alongside the rest of the collection.
Exceptions are:
    -   Legal-size (or smaller) items that constitute less than a ½
        manuscript box. These are given to the AV to be placed in the
        small collections hanging files.
    -   Oversize items that will not adequately fit in the largest
        available flat box (approx. 30" x 40"). Contact AV for storage
        options.
-   **Photographic negatives** are transferred to the AV Department
    -   Color negatives should not be left with other materials due to
        off-gassing damage.
-   **Audio, film, or video recordings** are transferred to AV
-   **Fine art or sculpture** are transferred to AV

**Mechanics**

Regardless of final stacks destination, house the material according to
format.

Single or small groupings of photographic prints can be left interfiled
with other materials if important to their context. In those cases,
interleave the prints and surrounding materials with acid-free bond
paper.

When separating photographic negatives, an option is to place them in
folded bond paper and then into a folder. Write any descriptive
information on the bond paper or folder tab.

-   If transferring boxes to AV, label the boxes (leave AV location blank).
-   If transferring folders or single items (including oversize) to AV, either label (if applicable) or write the collection title, accession #, and item \# on the folder tab, lightly penciled on the back of the item(s), or written on a separate sheet of paper and attached to the item(s) with a paperclip.
-   If material is to be shelved alongside the collection, place legal-size (or smaller) items upright in manuscript boxes; oversized materials in flat boxes. In addition to the collection label, boxes need a blue [AV Material label](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections Arrangement_Description/Labels/Processing_Labels_AV_blue.doc).

Once the collection is processed, email the AV Archivist and bring the materials to them. **Do not place material in AV stacks unless instructed to do so by the AV archivist.** The AV Archivist will add location(s) to the ASpace Resource Record.

### Description

AV material is described according to the level of processing.

-   Regardless of final stacks location, AV materials are added to the collection inventory either as the last series (level I & II only) or the last items listed (level III).
    - If single folders (unboxed) are being transferred to AV, use "AV" in lieu of box number in the "container instance"
    - If single items (unboxed) are being transferred to AV use "AV" in lieu of box number in the container instance and use "item" instead of "Folder" as the child type.
    - If boxes are being transferred to AV, continue sequential numbering (i.e., do not start over with Box 1).
    - Do not inventory at the item level (unless you only have a couple of items) but instead provide a general statement.
    - Information (gleaned from related documents or notations on the items themselves) such as dates, formats, subjects, events,amounts, sizes, etc. can be used.
    For example:
        -   10 oversize posters and awards, undated
        -   Photographs; Detroit Protests, 1967
        -   8 color slides, 1979
        -   Negatives; Family portraits, 1930-1989
        -   Audiocassette tapes; Conferences, 1960-1969
-   Important information about any AV material, such as their original location, is included in the collection or series scope and content note.
-   If material is transferred to the AV Department, describe the material transferred (complete with box numbers) in the Resource Record in Notes Separated Material.
    For example:
    -   Slides and photographic negatives (Box 10) have been transferred to AV
    -   1 film (Box AV) has been transferred to AV

## Oral Histories

Oral history materials at the Reuther can be part of papers or records
collections, duplicates of material at other archives used for reference
purposes, or discrete projects conducted by Reuther staff, donors, or
other related parties in accordance with the Reuther's mission. The
following guidelines address all oral history materials from
accessioning to access.

Oral History (OH) material is defined as any combination of the following:

-   Analog audio and video recordings (film, magnetic, or optical)
-   Digital audio and video files (mp3, mp4, wav, etc.)
-   Transcripts (paper copies and/or electronic files)

### Arrangement

Regardless of how an OH is acquired, if it entails any type of
recording, in addition to transcripts, there could be a physical
separation of materials due to preservation concerns and access. Use the
following guidelines to determine where to store materials:

-   **Hard copy, machine-dependent media** such as reel-to-reel, film, cassette, VHS tapes, Hi-8 tapes, digital Hi-8 tapes, CDs and DVDs are to be transferred to AV

-   **Born digital recordings** are to be uploaded to the [server](#project-materials).
    -   If a transcript(s) is part of a unique accession or accrual to a
        unique accession (this includes discrete projects and
        duplicates): Hard-copy(s) are to be boxed and shelved at 3N-F-1
        if space allows. Single transcripts are to be placed in the last
        available individual oral history box and a specific arrangement
        statement added to the resource record.
    -   Digital-copy(s) are to be uploaded to the server.

-   If the **transcript(s)** is part of a papers or records collection:
    -   They stay with the collection regardless of format
    -   If digital (e.g., stored on CDs) within an analog collection,
        upload digital files to the server, then dispose of original
        media
    -   If digital within an entirely digital collection, they will be
        stored with the rest of the digital content

-   If the **transcripts and/or recordings** are digital:
    -   First name the materials using the following conventions that
        apply to both born-digital and digitized oral history recordings
        and transcripts. For consistency, "OH" is added to the file
        name, immediately following the accession number, regardless of
        whether OH is already part of the accession number prefix.
        Three-digit counter numbers are then added, beginning with 001
        and increasing to 999 (if needed). Counter numbers represent
        individual recordings and transcripts, disambiguating items in
        larger oral history collections, and providing machine
        readability. Recording and transcript numbers are automatically
        differentiated by file name extension (e.g. recordings may end
        in mp3, mp4, wav, etc., and transcripts will end in .pdf).
    -   Continue to use established numbering conventions for
        corresponding physical materials. These numbers may parallel the
        numbering for digital materials, but will not be identical to it
        (e.g., LOH002210.1 for physical recordings and physical
        transcripts).

### Recordings

File Name: **AccessionNumber_OH_Counter#_TapeSide** (if applicable)

For recordings on tape, always use "A" or "B" to denote TapeSide. If there is a recording only on one side of the tape, always use "A" to denote TapeSide, even if the recording was started on side B.

Examples:

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LOH002210_OH_001_A.wav | an oral history recording on side A of a tape, or an oral history recording from a tape only recorded on a single side |
| UR000501_OH_024_B.mp3 | an oral history recording on side B of a tape from a records collection |
| UOH000037_OH_007.wav | an oral history recording from a CD or born digital |

### Transcripts

File Name: **AccessionNumber_OH_Counter#**

Examples:

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LOH002210_OH_001.pdf | an oral history transcript |
| UR000501_OH_024.pdf | an oral history transcript from a records collection |

### Additional Project Materials

Use the following convention for additional project materials such as
project documentation, draft transcripts, biographical sketches,
resumes, etc.

File Name: **AccessionNumber_OH_Counter#_Counter#**

Examples:

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LOH001952_OH_000_001.doc | a project-level file #1, e.g. project proposal |
| LOH001952_OH_000_002.doc | a project-level file #2, e.g. final budget |
| LOH001952_OH_001_001.doc | interview #1 draft transcript |
| LOH001952_OH_001_002.doc | interview #1 additional case file materials, interviewee resume, etc. |

Much of the above materials will go in the case file, but some project-level and/or related files may be placed in Access and Preservation folders in the Digital Hold, such as introductory essays, interviewee biographies, and the like.

Next, arrange the materials using the following guidelines for arranging born digital/digitized oral history transcripts and recordings.

#### Project Materials

1.  Ensure all files follow oral history naming conventions([recordings](#recordings), [transcripts](#transcripts), [project materials](#additional-project-materials).
2.  Determine if the file is access or preservation:
    1. Access: PDF, MP3, JPEG, MP4
    2. Preservation: PDF/A, WAV, TIFF (If the material does not exist in a preservation format, put the original file in the preservation folder, e.g., JPEG.)
3.  Next, determine if the oral history is from a donor organization, or an individual project.
4.  Based on this information, the file is arranged as follows:
    1. Access file, OH is part of an organization: HOLD01 > OH > Access > [organization] > [accession #]
    2. Access file, OH is not part of an organization: HOLD01 > OH > Access > Projects > [accession #] OR HOLD01 > OH > Access > Individual > [accession #]
    3. Preservation file, OH is part of an organization: HOLD01 > OH > Preservation > [organization] > [accession #]
    4. Preservation file, OH is NOT part of an organization: HOLD01 > OH > Preservation > Projects > [accession #] OR HOLD01 > OH > Preservation > Individual > [accession #]

**Examples:**

-   Access > SWE > LOH002110 > LOH002110_OH_001.pdf
-   Preservation > SWE > LOH002110 > LOH002110_OH_008.wav

#### Case File Materials

1.  Create a case file for the oral history if one does not already exist: HOLD02 > Casefiles > Oral Histories > [accession #]
2.  Add the following materials to the oral history's digital case file and ensure all files follow oral history naming conventions:
    - Original unedited/non-finalized transcripts (MS Word or PDF)
    - Closed audio or video records

### Mechanics

1.  Media transferred to AV should be labeled with the full accession
    number (including the unique identifier for multiple interview
    projects).
2.  Digital files of any format (audio, video, transcripts) should be
    named following the file naming convention above.
3.  Hard-copy transcripts should be foldered by interview. Folder should
    be labeled with box-folder number, interviewee name, date, and
    accession number.
4.  Once the collection is processed and transferred items have been
    delivered to and stored by the AV department, add location(s) to the
    resource record.
5.  **If an oral history(s) is part of a papers or records collection**,
    the box labels containing recording media will reflect the accession
    number of the entire collection and each individual tape should
    still be labeled with the accession number plus the unique
    identifier.

### Description

Oral histories receive the same level of description as papers and
records collections so that they are discoverable during a search of the
Reuther's complete holdings.

1.  Note all formats (AV and transcript) in the folder title. List
    transcripts and media separately to physically account for all
    material.
2.  If the collection is only being described at the top collection
    level, the oral history(s) should be mentioned in the scope and
    contents note and the box inventory, if applicable.
3.  Note all machine-dependent media being physically transferred to the
    AV Department in the resource record under Separated Material.
4.  The name of the interviewees should be listed either in a scope and
    content note or a box or folder listing
5.  Unique identifiers for each interview do not need to be recorded in
    the resource record notes. They will only be accounted for in an
    item-level inventory, if included.

#### Examples

Examples are given to help illustrate above points. Refer to oral history notes in [ArchivesSpace: Resource Records](02_03_resources.md) for full description procedures.

**Example 1:**

In a 5-series manuscript collection, OH material is arranged in the last series (2 boxes) and described. Box 83 contains transcripts that stay with the collection. Box 84 contains tapes physically transferred to AV

1.  The Separated Material note of the resource record states them transfer:

!!! note "Separated Material"
    Oral history audiotapes (Box 84) were transferred to AV

2.  The Arrangement note of the resource record states a general description:

!!! note "Arrangement"
    Papers are divided into 5 series:
    Series V: Linden NJ Plant interviews, 1980s-1990s

  ```


**Example 3:**

In a discrete oral history project, hard-copy transcripts are boxed and shelved at 3N-F-1. The box: folder listing reflects their order as per normal arrangement & description procedures. Audiotapes (less than one box) are physically transferred to AV

1.  The Separated Material note in the resource record states the transfer:

!!! note "Separated Material"
    Oral history audiotapes were transferred to AV

2.  The Arrangement note in the resource record details how the formats are listed in the inventory:

!!! note "Arrangement"
    Oral history transcripts are listed alphabetically. Recordings are listed under AV Material.

3.  The inventory states formats of the interviews:

  LOH001000_OH_001.pdf    Jim Taylor; transcript, 1985
  ```


## Newspaper Clippings

Clippings are not prime research material and should not take up
significant time. Only clippings with important contextual information
should be photocopied. For **Level I** processing: Trim down as much as
possible. If known, write the name of the newspaper and the date in
pencil on the clipping. For **all Levels**: Segregate the clippings from
the rest of the collection by foldering separately or interleaving
acid-free bond paper.

## Oversize Items

Remove material such as charts, maps, diplomas, and certificates from
the main body of the collection. If appropriate, create a separation
sheet on bond paper with penciled notation of the item's disposition in
its original location. Oversized clippings can be folded to fit in the
folders.

1.  Unroll or unfold items and place in labeled oversized folders in an oversized box or communal oversized box, depending on quantity. If item(s) are too big for an OS box, contact the AV Department for alternative housing options.
2.  Keep notes about the oversized materials to include in the [Resource Record](02_03_resources.md):
  1. Extent -- Include in total linear footage and mark the inclusion of OS material in the parentheses describing the number and type of boxes in the collection e.g. (5 SB), 2 maps or (5 SB, 1 OS)
  2. Separated Material -- if items are to be stored in the AV department, indicate their transfer in this section
  3. Box-Folder listing -- if items are to be shelved along with the rest of the collection in the main stacks, include a list of their contents in this section, where appropriate (e.g. as part of a series or as their own stand-alone series).

## Publications

!!! note "ALUA"
  The following items should remain with ALUA collections when the processing archivist determines they should be kept:

    - Labor periodicals, newspapers, and newsletters (runs and scattered issues)
    - Urban-related serials published by organizations whose records we collect (runs and scattered issues)
    - Labor agreements/contracts and supplements (final draft only, one access copy and one preservation copy)
    - Constitutions and bylaws
    - Convention proceedings
    - Books and other publications with a flat, sewn-in or glued spine
    - Pamphlets, booklets, and other printed material with a folded, stapled spine or spiral binding
    - Publications related to a topic that reflects the interests of the donor
    - Items all related to the same topic, the removal of which would destroy the collected body of information

!!! note "WSU"
  The University Archivist determines the disposition of the following items found in University collections:

    - Annual reports
    - University Council minutes (runs)
    - Board of Governors minutes (runs)
    - Academic Senate minutes (runs)
    - The South End
    - Inside Wayne State
        - In most cases, isolated publications (e.g. a pamphlet attached to correspondence, or a booklet within a folder of other materials) will be left in place.
        - Larger amounts of publications can be left as found within the collection (Level III), placed with existing corresponding records series (Level I or II), or grouped together as a publications series (Level I or II), depending on the collection. They can be boxed with non-AV collection materials.
        - Folder items in groups by subject heading rather than individually, when possible. Alternately, folder by publication title if amount so warrants (i.e. there is at least one folder).
        - Regardless of processing Level, publications should be minimally inventoried. Use of the materials may dictate further processing, such as an inventory by publication title, later.

!!! note past practice has been to separate publications from the collections and catalog them, under purview of the Reuther Librarian (a position that no longer exists).

## Microfilm and Microfiche

Microfilm and microfiche are described and noted in the Resource Record.
Microfiche remains physically stored with the collection (in a separate
folder or box), while microfilm is separated and stored in the Reading
Room microfilm cabinet.

1. Describe microfilm and microfiche in context as it is found in the collection. Where it is a duplicate of paper material, do not describe twice.

2. Place separated microfilm reels in a microfilm box, found in the Audiovisual Department. Like photographs, microfiche in small quantities may be left in its original place in the collection where appropriate.

3. Indicate the presence of microfilm material in the Resource Record.
  1. Use the Existence and Location of Copies -- Other Copies field to denote that the microfilm is a duplication of other material in the collection (i.e. paper materials). Also indicate which material is the use copy.
  2. Use the Separated Materials - Transfers field to denote that the microfilm is unique material that has been transferred.
  3. List the quantity of microfilm reels in the extent.

4.  Transfer microfilm to the cabinet in the Reuther Library reading room. Assign a location following the last documented reel in the cabinet. This location will begin with 3R-A-2, followed by the microfilm box number (i.e., 3R-A-2(29).

5.  Include the microfilm's location in the collection's Resource Record location note.

## Sensitive Materials

As much as possible, identify any documents of a very personal nature such as:

| EXAMPLES |
| --- |
| Personnel, "Personnel Committee," or Human Resources files, including performance evaluations|
| Student records|
| Grievance |
| Legal case files |
| Police or prison records |
| Social work case files |
| Medical (including psychiatric) records |
| Military records |
| Financial records |
| Intimate personal correspondence |
| Intimate diary passages |
| Interviews, or any documents that contain statements which may be libelous |

2. Decide if items should be discarded, given back to the donor, restricted, or kept in the collection.
  1. IF KEPT IN OPEN COLLECTION:
    1. Add minimal description in the Resource Record (i.e. use general terms to encompass several folders or boxes of material instead of listing each folder title)
        2. Where appropriate, apply a restriction to the collection:
        - Check the "restrictions apply" box under Basic Information
        - Describe restricted material in the [Conditions GoverningAccess/Use](../03_shared/03_04_notes.md#conditions-governing-access) sections.
        - Include whether a Restricted Use Form is required (generally limited to collections where material may not be quoted or cited; names and other personal information, which might identify an individual, cannot be cited; material is confidential, etc.)
        3. To secure items with high monetary or intrinsic value (e.g., the correspondence of famous people, cartoon drawings):
        - Transfer item(s) to the vault with a photocopy in its original place.
        - The folder(s) should reference where the copies were (Box-Folder numbers) and completely state the collection title and accession number.
        - The folders are then stored in the available accumulated SB in the vault.
        - Include statement of transfer in the Separated Materials note of the resource record, statement of access in the Access note, and vault shelf location in the Location note of the ArchivesSpace record.
        4. Note specific restricted folders or boxes in the inventory
        5. Apply "restricted use" [labels](https://waynestateprod.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Libraries/Reuther/Documents/Collections/Arrangement_Description/Labels?csf=1&web=1&e=gLZBpF) to boxes containing restricted material
  2. IF DISCARDED:
      - Make a list of items removed from the collection and add it to the case file and in the Resource Record Collection Management subrecord.
      - Shred material after the collection is fully arranged and described.
  3. IF CLOSED temporarily:
      - Do not describe closed portions in any published subrecord of the Resource Record. Either leave those portions unpublished or make a separate list to keep in the case file.
      - Be sure the Resource Record's "restrictions apply" box is checked and the items are described in the "repository processing notes."
      - Create a [Temporarily Closed](../03_shared/03_02_events.md#temporarily-closed) event linked to the resource record so these items can be added when opened.
