# ArchivesSpace Accession Records
An **ArchivesSpace accession record** is used to record initial information about a collection. An accession record should be created for a collection as soon as possible after the materials enter the Reuther's custody. Accession records are living documents that should be kept up to date as information changes or additional information becomes known about a particular accession.
 
Edit the information in [ ]s (and delete the brackets). Choose the proper selection from those listed in italics.
 
The instructions below can be used both for creating and editing accession records.

1. Select Create > Accession OR open an accession record and Select > Edit 
2. If you created a **new** accession record: The Home / Accessions / New Accession screen is loaded. This page is where you will enter all of the collection’s accession information. If you opened an accession record: The Accession record is opened in edit mode.
3. The Accession record will contain more subrecords and fields than those listed below, but **do NOT enter/change any information in a field that is not indicated below.**
4. An asterisk next to a field name simply means it is required by ASpace.
